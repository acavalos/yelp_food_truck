sactomofo nogo  excited day got really food trucks trying sf watching food truck race show parked blocks away problem arrived right 12 place jam packed full people great see many people supporting mobile food hard choose long seemed never ending line people picked one shortest actually food deserts skipped breakfast thinking would crawling floor back car afterwards bad idea waited mama kims go 2 hours took time parking meter  42 fine darnit  banh mi actually tasty 2 hours worth time  maybe worth 45 minutes time bbq tri tip sliders okay although standing long food would taste smell good highlight event interviewed kcra finally received food said things maybe even suggestions next year ended shortened waited line 2 hours  think event success really left people wanting leave first truck 2 hours one line believe trucks lines might split smaller portions planners might need change bit get people like come back next year really wanted spend money multiple trucks wasnt case  clarify review based first sactomofo
hope people showed complained left least signed petition huffing puffing away yes wanted get grub main goal event raise awareness garner public support mobile food vendors deprive city something novel offer limited time course theres going mob scene overall weather cooperative people awesome smart people either bring friends make friends help split line duties
looking forward day couple months left wanting tried food two vendors drewskis hot rod kitchen esthers cupcakes got event 12noon immediately got line drewskis stayed line 2pm got food waited line last 30 minutes one friends decided go wait inline esthers outcome got cupcakes even got food  wth long story short group friends ate drewskis esthers 20 bueno future charge nominal fee admittance event look bigger park location overall friends great time enjoyed day fun sun sign petition support trucks
