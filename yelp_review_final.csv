Food Truck Cinema,"Sacramento, CA",9/23/2018,5,"I just drove from Sacramento to Concord to see the movie, Top gun. My outdoor cinema experience was fantastic. I took pics of children running around playing the games organized for them. I ate delicious Veggetarian pasta and had a beer. They had custard ice cream. The moon was back behind us looking nearly full. Every now and then I looked off in the direction of the rolling hills. Amazing evening. I finally got to see the movie Top gun!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UOAFBrDQ7NUVvHz5b8HMFg
Food Truck Cinema,"Roseville, CA",7/30/2018,4,Absolutely love food truck cinema. I have attended the event in Roseville a couple of times after purchasing the GroupOn tickets. The normal ticket price isn't too bad either. The event is well ran and so organized and safe that I can even leave my chairs and blankets unattended while I get my food. My only suggestion or desire would be is to possibly show older movies or a chick flick. It was like be a perfect date night event.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0ludUxz0xd4X8U9-J3uGuQ

People of all ages were at the event...everything was interactive, trivia before the movie, everything over by 10.  Can't ask for much more than that! <br><br>I came from Stockton to be at this event, got here about 5:45 and got amazing seats! Everything is on the lawn so bring a blanket or a small beach chair to be comfortable. Early tickets were only 10 bucks and worth every penny. <br><br>The whole event was well thought out and done from start to finish...I wish they did stuff like this in Stockton but I will continue to drive to Roseville for this fun. <br><br>They are planning another event in a month with Top Gun.

Food Truck Cinema,"Sacramento, CA",11/6/2017,3,"Have to get here super early to have a decent spot.

Food Truck Cinema,"San Bruno, CA",12/21/2017,2,"Purchased prepaid tix to see a summer film in the park up north-VIP tix. I contacted them twice via phone well before the event, b/c i dont live in the local area and needed some info. on how the VIP vs the general admission was. Nobody contacted back. I didn't show up to the park until 30 minutes before the film, and parked inside their park. By the time i arrived, there were no lines, and i had to ask a few ppl lingering around about getting inside and my VIP ""tix"". The organizers were about to leave and he just told me to go find a spot in the front section. Well, EVERYONE had blankets and laid down camping chairs and gear. Lots of ppl who weren't VIP tix holders were in front, so how does this make it fair? i thought there were closed off sections. Just zero customer service (no calls back), seems to not have mattered on how much you paid as it's ""sit as you like"" type of deal. I won't be attending any of their events. The screen wasn't that great. Too many ppl talking and being rude...but that's not the fault of the company putting this together.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=USdWbCN1iovQFy1AQp2TRw
Food Truck Cinema,"Roseville, CA",12/29/2016,5,My family and I had an amazing time at Food-truck cinema watching my father's favorite movie Top Gun!  We all went off our diets and enjoyed burgers and ice cream sundaes from the really cool Food Trucks.   The scenery was amazing watching the movie on the beautiful wood creek golf course under the stars.  They did such a great job with the ginormous movie screen and the surround sound that made those planes roar over our heads!  We will definitely be back in the new year.  Did I mention the fabulous wines and craft beer selections?  Job well done by all.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WQDSMshhsmAfDeKNJ4LyDg

La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Rocklin, CA",10/8/2018,4,"Ate at La Mex at the Water Lantern Festival, and my teen said it was the best burrito he's ever had in his life, even better than his favorite place. He wouldn't even let me have a bite!<br><br>I got the fish tacos, and they were good, but it was the end of the night and my fish was pretty soggy. If the fish had some crispness/firmness to it, they would have been way up there on my favorites list. <br><br>And, the service was outstanding!

La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Cupertino, CA",8/24/2018,2,"Got a surf n turf burrito with no sour cream today for lunch. My friend requested the same burrito but asked for the steak to be substituted with fish because she's pescatarian! Our food came out 15 mins later and immediately we were surprised that our burrito didn't feel pippin hot when we were holding onto it.  I love when my food comes out hot because it makes me feel like I'm eating some very fresh. But this burrito felt very cold, like they pre-made all the items and didn't keep them heated up. It was very disappointing to pay $10 for a burrito that had below room temperature steak and shrimp.  The cheese inside was not melted at all nor was the tortilla warm which makes me really believe that all items are made super fast without thought.<br><br>The biggest problem was my friends burrito did not have fish as she requested AND there were pieces of meat in there. She doesn't eat meat and I t's really frustrating when the cashier says the change to fish is doable but does not communicate to the person making the burrito the change. <br><br>On top of that they charge 50 cents for using credit cards. Since I've been to these food truck events I was surprised since other food trucks don't normally charge the fee for using credit cards.  I would not come back to this food truck again.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=G8a47i1PnvDCLH12jrgnAg
La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Sacramento, CA",10/18/2018,2,"It was ok, not the best burrito in town. Good-sized but was a bit dry, could've used some more sour cream and maybe salsa.

La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",5/17/2017,3,"I tried their Fish tacos at Sac Food Truck wars at the old railyard. I was expecting grilled pieces of fish but my tacos looked like it had minced fish. The texture was that of minced fish too. I think Chandos has better fish tacos, but ill give La Mex another shot next time and order other things from their menu and update my review. Overall their fish tacos were ok. The ingredients were fresh and its a filling serving of 4 street tacos with chips on the side.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1noEnpLlagabkc7TXKXBBQ

La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Downtown Core, Davis, CA",5/16/2018,3,"Of all the taco trucks that roll in UC Davis, this is the closest one that actually get things right. Having a salsa bar like a actual taco truck should have is what's making this food truck as good as it is. The burrito was close to being good. I got a super burrito that only contained rice, beans, cheese, meat, and some sour cream for $10, guac not included but for an extra $1.50. The burrito looked and felt decently sized but I wasn't completely full. Good attempt from another taco truck that rips the college students of Davis off. props for having a salsa bar though haha.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oOG0ZiGcuaT1iIXBn1Evvg
La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",6/15/2016,3,"Stumbled upon this truck during the lunch hour at the capitol. We looked over the menu for a brief moment and placed our orders. My buddy ordered a couple of chicken and beef tacos. I chose to go with a couple shrimp and fish tacos. My buddy got his order in a timely manner but my tacos took sometime. It was a bit inconvenient as my buddy was nice enough to wait for me, but at the same time we were in a time constraint due to the lunch hour break. <br><br>Once we opened our Styrofoam boxes I was pleased to see my tacos, but I can't say the same for my buddy. He looked disappointed, because for the price he thought he would get something a bit more elaborate than some ""street"" tacos. We both scarfed our tacos down, I enjoyed the fish tacos, but the shrimp tacos lacked in my opinion. <br><br>The workers in the truck were friendly and there is a door on the back end of the truck that says ""salsa"" where you can scoop out several varietyies of slalsa in to little plastic cups.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=U3w01iPvaufAhZlOfMDBkg
La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Folsom, CA",7/20/2017,2,"Visited them yesterday at the Folsom Sactomofo event and got a quesadilla because that's what my daughter wanted. Their menu is small which makes it easy to choose and their price includes any variety of meat they have with your tacos, burrito, or quesadilla. However, when i asked how much a plain quesadilla was they said price didn't matter if you get it without meat, it's the same. So yes a plain quesadilla with a few chips and sour cream will cost you $9 at this food truck. And if you pay with card, they'll ask you if the 50 cents charge is okay. Well, no I wouldn't like it but what am i gonna do? <br>There wasn't anything special about the food so I won't be back.<br>You've got a lot better options when it comes to Mexican food trucks, food trucks and Mexican food in general.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fisQzqVvitStQoKZfjRWcQ

Lol so I tried the gyro salad. It's a big portion filled with fresh salad and meat! Everything was perfect on it and I only finished half of it since it was a big portion. Loved everything about it. The gyro was delicious and different it falls apart verse it sticking together if that makes sense lol. I don't know how I feel about that but it's good. and they don't skimp out either.

This is by far the best food my senses have held the privilege experiencing in a very long time. The young guys running the show have excellent customer service and the food they serve is not only delicious, but delightfully scrumptious! <br><br>The chicken and lamb gyros were perfect- not too salty and they contained just the right amount of spices. The yogurt sauce is the magic touch that transcends your senses beyond what's worldly and to a new horizon. If one were to reflect on the theme of the old Red Bull commercials where the drink gave you wings- well, Hefty Gyros will do that to you without the jitters. <br><br>The Hefty fries were hefty and a must have. Let me put it this way: if you're a self titled foodie and have not tried Hefty Gyros then, well you are not actually a foodie and are instead living a lie.

I didn't really want to eat the lunch I brought today, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. The line was long and the prices were slightly less gouging than your normal food truck, so that's a plus I guess. <br><br>Sisig is my favorite item on another Phillipino food truck that comes here, so despite the fact that it said it contained pig snout and chicken liver, I braved the Sisig anyway, enticed by the jalapeños and lemon. NOPE. Not a fan. It's very rare that I won't eat something after having paid for it, but not today. Yuck. The texture was difficult to overcome but the lack of flavor made it not even worth trying. The garlic fried rice was bland at best. The lumpia, how dare they even call it that! No. This is an imposter. My mom, as white as she is, learned to make lumpia back in the day from a tiny little phillipino lady that her boyfriends brother was married to and it is glorious. I'll admit I'm picky about my lumpia but this was just a bummer. <br><br>Save your money until Wandering Boba makes its way around.

I was expecting Filipino style bbq since this was a Filipino food truck. But they were just covered in what seemed like store bought American bbq sauce. I got the chicken kabob and when I bit into it I thought something was off. I looked down at the piece that I ate and it was RAW. Completely RAW!!! I immediately spit it out . It looked like seared tuna, it was that undercooked. My fiancé ordered the pork and hers was also not cooked. Not as bad as mine but still not cooked. I gave it back to the guy at the window and waited. To my surprise they gave us back the same exact pieces that we had both already taken bites from.... i didn't think you could send something back to a customer after they had eaten some of it.

I grabbed a saplings worth of napkins as I anticipated the upcoming shaved ice disaster and grabbed a seat near the truck. As people passed by I noticed them glance at the chilly treat then double back for the truck. I really should have been paid for my advertising for them but I guess I was with the raspberry colossus that was starting to numb my hand. I tried to delicately eat away at the cone but there were casualties with the ground beneath my feet turning into a blue puddle of sugar water. Embarrassed, I walked away and found another spot only to create another lake. I was only able to eat a third (and I'm being liberal with my consumption here) but my husband was able to eat quite a bit. Unfortunately, the ice melted and I was left with a fifth of a container of blue colored sugar water. Iced sugar water is palatable but once it turned liquid, we had to toss it. <br><br>The rating is based on the shaved ice only but I am definitely looking out for it so I can try their smoothies!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ky9-RSIQp5bKf9rQjbzh6A
Smoothie Patrol,"San Jose, CA",9/24/2013,5,"They were catering an event in Sacramento's Discovery Park about 10 days ago and like other vendors, ran out of the large size drinks.. But I'm grateful I spent the 7 or 8 bucks to see if they were worth my tastebuds.. And they really impressed them lol. All the ingredients seemed to contain no additives just fresh fruit :) Smoothie patrol was right up there with Jamba Juice, and that's saying alot. I chose the Razzle Dazzle and my friend chose the Spazzmatic that I can't remember the name of..

Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Live Oak, CA",10/18/2018,5,"Out of all the Asian food trucks available in the Sac area, Kados is by far my favorite. Every Tuesday, I stop by the truck  at UC Davis to try something new on their menu. At this point I've had it all. <br><br>My favorite dish is the street tacos! There aren't any tacos around quite like them. Something about their slaw topped with their aioli makes these bad boys amazing. Definitely have to order them spicy.<br><br>If you are looking for something filling, I recommend going for it all and ordering a three meat sampler plate. You get to try the three meats they offer over a bed of rice, and a side of sprouts and salad. <br><br>Lastly, out of all the trucks I go to at UC Davis, this truck overlaps the others in customer service. The very few times I've had an issue, or if there was any confusion, the owners and their staff made sure to accommodate me.

Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Davis, CA",10/17/2018,2,Caught it on the UC Davis campus last night outside Silo.<br><br>The tacos say served "street style".  Street style is two regular sized corn tortillas per taco (because corn tortillas break).   These are served on single mini tortillas.   Not street style but the price is okay at $8 for 3.  Can't give more than 2 stars when they are described as "street style" and are not for two extremely obvious reasons.  <br><br>The real winner here was the teriyaki chicken bowl.  Decent rice for a food truck and a nice succulent char.  I could eat a pound of this chicken by itself.   At $10 per bowl that would come to about $30.<br><br>Service here was grumpy.   The lady that took my order seemed pissed off when I asked what the chicken was seasoned with.   Order was ready at the pick up window in less than 3 minutes and that dude was cheerful.

The roll was good.. simple.. I don't know about $10 for it but I appreciate the vegan options and I liked it.

Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Citrus Heights, CA",5/23/2018,4,"I have to be honest that I haven't really ate from a whole lot of food trucks. Aside from the typical ""taco"" trucks, I am still an amateur at venturing into unique and one-of-a-kind offerings from other types of foods on four wheels. Well, this particular truck called ""Kado's Asian Grill Food Truck"" was definitely above average from my standards.<br><br>After attending UC Davis' annual ""Picnic Day"" event which is always held during the 3rd April of every year, I was in need of something that would be way better than your typical hot dogs and cheeseburgers. After reading several Yelp reviews about this place, I figured I would give it a try. <br><br>The line wasn't too long but the weather was very cooperative with sunny skies and about 80°. After patiently waiting for nearly 30 minutes, I was finally ready to place my order. I decided to go with 1/2 &amp; 1/2 combination plate a.k.a. ""Kado's Special Chicken &amp; Teriyaki Chicken"". This consisted of steamed white rice, marinated bean sprouts, and Asian salad. Price (as of April 2018) was a decent $12.<br><br>After opening up the cardboard container it was packaged in, this place gives you a TON of food! And you definitely get your moneys' worth. My teriyaki chicken was tender, moist, and had the perfect zest of sauce that made this very tasty. The Kado's chicken was over the top amazing though; they use a marinaded blend of honey, Kaffir lime leaves, and Sriracha which gave the overall flavor a truly unique one. I highly recommend anyone that visits a Kado's food truck to give this one a try. The sprouts and salad were just average, nothing too thrilling about that.<br><br>Overall, ""Kado's Asian Grill"" is a truck that was surprisingly delicious. The exterior pistachio colored green is definitely not hard to miss. I would definitely follow them on Facebook as they give frequent updates of where their truck will be located. For the most part, they make trips around the Davis and Sacramento areas. With that said and done, this is a truck I will eat at again. My rating, a solid four stars.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yFb-Hqr8k6uIfwCQ3BO4dQ
Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Toronto, Canada",10/19/2017,5,"I LOVED this little food truck!<br>Quick, efficient, filling and friendly. <br>And I actually ran into this spot by accident. It was stationed in a parking lot beside a building I had to go into. The vibrant colours caught my eye and so I walked on over to check it out. <br><br>Out front, they had a cute little area set up for people to eat. There were a couple tables shaded by the sun by umbrellas. <br><br>I approached the window - the worker was very friendly and asked what I wanted with a smile. <br><br>There were a few categories on the menu. <br>The first step was to CHOOSE YOUR STYLE: <br>- Rice bowl<br>- Salad<br>- 50/50 bowl<br>- Plate. <br>Then you got to choose your meat.<br>- Kado's special chicken<br>- Teriyaki chicken<br>- Teriyaki flank steak<br>- Half and half<br>- Three meat sampler<br>Although there were also VEGGIE and VEGAN options as well as TACOS and a few sides. It all sounded good to me!!!<br><br>I ended up grabbing the rice bowl with teriyaki flank steak. It was SO good! Steak is always a risky thing to get if it's not from a steak house as I find it's always overdone (that is assuming you don't like steak well done). I like a medium rare, and Kado's Asian Grill cooked the steak to perfection! I was very impressed and would love to go back to try the other styles.

They had me at rice bowls and I didn't bother giving other food trucks my business after trying a sample of their chicken . As soon as you walk up to their truck , you will be greeted by the owners daughter and then you will be asked if you'd like any samples .

Unfortunately the flavors of kafir and lime weren't visible but I still thought the chicken was good . For my side , I got the fried rice instead of white rice. The fried rice was really good ! I'd say that it was the highlight of my meal . My best friend ordered the ribs with fried rice and regretted it. Although the ribs were covered in sauce, I took a few bites and noticed that the meat itself was tough and dry which was disappointing . <br><br>Overall, I'd  say the food was just ok .

It's a little too loud though as the building is brick. I'd rather have sat outside so we could hear it as background. Also, they don't have a hard liquor license so don't order mixed drinks unless you like them made with wine. We missed that detail but they graciously took back the not-so-great rice wine bloody mary and brought a glass of champagne in its place.<br>I love this wonderful old building in Uptown. It can be a hard place to attract business because everyone's going downtown, so go - support the great restaurateurs who are trying to make it happen here too.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Xzb978usJCSWBjLCyllhrw

Bambi,"Sacramento, CA",8/20/2018,5,"Some of the best tacos I've had in Sac! <br><br>I first heard about Bambi a couple months back when some vegan friends of mine on FB started posting photos of truck sightings in Sacramento.

Plus, this is probably TMI but I have borderline paranoia about contracting some food-borne illness by eating meals prepared in trucks--it just seems like a hot-bed for unsanitary preparation. Fears be damned, I sought them out anyway. <br><br>And, I'm so glad I took a gamble on this place because Bambi allayed my fears on both accounts--the food was stellar with terrific presentation and flavor profile AND the truck was impeccably clean. Not only that but the staff servicing the truck and making the food were super chill and open to talking about their plans to expand.

Kudos to you Bambi!<br><br>A few of the taco offerings include: Cornmeal crusted Eggplant with fresh slaw, homemade ""chorizo"" and potato, spicy cauliflower, pickled veggies, jackfruit ""meat"", and more. A fried crispy shell and some with guacamole make each one instagram-worthy! The kitchen and truck are immaculate and crowds start to gather around when they arrive.<br><br>I do have 1 issue with the menu: Almost everything is deep fried, grilled in oil or Made with heavy starch and carbs. I get it, fat makes everything taste better, but a few healthier options (besides the pickled onions and fresh garnishes) that are not fried/grilled would be great. Even the slaw has a ton of oil (albeit probably a delicious organic olive oil). <br><br>The beauty of offering vegan food is the opportunity to be creative. Cornmeal crusted eggplant? Yes please! There is no dispute, this was insanely good, but not everyone who is vegan wants a fat carb bomb sitting in their stomach.<br><br>So, I ask the wonderful clever team behind this truck to please consider a few different, possibly healthier options?<br><br>If not, I will still continue to praise this restaurant on wheels, and on occasion, as a special treat, order up a delicious, maddeningly good fried taco.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3C8qIpUX48siYEdzTs1mrQ

Bambi,"Elk Grove, CA",8/15/2018,4,"Good food, VERY limited menu, very pricey for what it is ($6 for one small taco???), but I'm just so happy to be seeing a vegan option in the area that isn't Asian food. (Don't get me wrong- I love Asian food, but typically that's about 90% of the vegan food I find.) Their nachos we're almost too spicy for my husband and I to eat, so I'll have to ask them next time if there's a way to tone that down. The Bambi taco ($4) was delicious and I would have eaten two more of those if they weren't so dang expensive. The $6 eggplant taco, which I expected to be my favorite, had only three small pieces of eggplant and not much else going on. I will definitely be seeking them out, but expecting to spend more than twice as much as I normally do at a food truck.

The fries were thick cut with a bit of the skins left on, and not greasy, as another reviewer had mentioned. That being said, these fries are softer and floppier, not crisp as some might expect from their fries. Still tasty, though. The veg were a little overdone... a minute or two less on the grill might be perfect!<br><br>The Tri Tip Sandwich was fresh, but not something I would order again. On their own, all the components of the sandwich tasted fresh and adequately prepared, but together, the sandwich was somewhat underwhelming.

Regardless, in concert, the sandwich itself was somewhat flat and lifeless. Pass. <br><br>The one thing I have to mention is that the truck takes FOREVER to take your order &amp; prepare it.

Expensive, but not a big issue if the food taste good.  <br><br>I get my food and I go back to the library, I'm about to take a bite but I notice a dark red piece poking out from under the patty, it was a slice of bacon. I do not eat bacon for religious restrictions. No problem, mistakes happen, lets just go back and have them fix it?<br><br>I go back and the cashier(Who i am assuming was the daughter) hears about this, I tell her I am  allergic(easier to explain, and less likely they will mess it up after hearing that). She takes the burger to hand off to the cooks(Mom and Dad possibly). I think at this point, they forgot that their food truck has windows that individuals can see through. What happened next is the reason I am leaving them a 1 star review.<br><br>Reason for the one star review: The cook(the mom) moved her hand towards the burger, pulled something, and the other hand put the bun back on. I do not know why she thought I could not see this. She turned around and gave the burger back and said there is no bacon on the burger. She literally lied to a customer. Granted the girl did not inform the cook that I just told her I was allergic, but that does not justify lying to a customer. <br><br>This is simply an unethical way to run a family business. <br><br>After I told her that I know there was bacon on it, she did not respond and just started to angrily make the burger(as if it was my fault). She shouted out, what was your order? Proceeded to make it. During this time, the other cook(I'm assuming was the dad) was yelling loudly at the Mom about the orders. By the time my new burger was done, the girl was about to call the order out for me to get but noticed there was no fries on the new order. She asks the Mom about the fries, but doesn't get a response. She just hands me the burger, I asked, ""What about the fries?"" The mom just throws the fries in and I get my new food. <br><br>The quality of the food was alright, it was definitely not worth $13.00.<br><br>TLDR: Angus burger doesnt come with bacon, but it had bacon on it.

I wanted some delicious food truck lunch, and I got bland, lame, mushy nachos made with obviously canned cheese sauce and no real cheese whatsoever. What are good nachos without gooey cheese on top?? I saw a picture posted previously and it looked like that costumer had got nachos that came with REAL cheese and some type of yummy looking sauce on top, but mine didn't have any of this. <br><br>I'm giving three stars because the portion was huge for the price ($8) and it seems like they didn't up their prices like the other food trucks at the festival did. This was the only place that I could get a pretty affordable meal- but maybe that's because they compromised their quality. That might have been a mistake, because I know that at least for me, next time I have a choice between food trucks and Azteca is one of them, I will most definitely choose another truck, regardless of price.

Paquitas Mexican Grill,"Sacramento, CA",10/11/2018,5,"This is actually an updated review of Paquitas. The first few visits I had a less than 5 star experience and did detail it in my original yelp. After the family that runs this truck went through a horrific experience that resulted in all of them being significantly injured they re-opened after a few months. <br><br>I always want to support local business and so I decided to give them another chance. Unfortunatelu I arrived right as they were closing but the owner approached me, and assured me they would be open the next day and invited me back. He asked my name and realized that I was the person that had written the original post. BUT he wasn't rude or intimidating at all. He assured me that he read my review, and wanted me to have a much better experience and again invited me back the next day. <br><br>I didn't make it back until the next week but he remembered me and rolled out the red carpet. I don't get the feeling that this was solely about the yelp review, but rather this was a family owned business that literally has poured their blood sweat and tears into their business. They are working hard to establish themselves as a fixture in the neighborhood and genuinely worked to rebuild and reframe my experience. <br><br>I give 3 stars alone for the customer service. They owned what happened previously and worked to make it right. The entire family was a pleasure to speak to and they clearly want to build a business that meets the needs of all their customers. <br><br>The final two stars are the food. Yummy options and the chicken quesadilla is my (and my daughter's) favorite! Last time my husband got the carne asada fries and OMG they were huge, cheesy, and delicious. We've had the tacos and really enjoyed those as well. <br><br>I look forward to future visits and trying more of Their yummy options. Keep an eye out on next door for deals.

How can you pass up a chartreuse food truck?<br><br>The truck looks clean and the menu is pretty clear. The food was a little on the slow side, but it was also pretty busy (continous people coming up, but no line at the window). Can't fault them for being popular.<br><br>I got the Kado's Seasoned Chicken rice bowl (not the teriyaki) and it was definitely a healthy size portion. Enough for 2 people not really hungry. And Yum! I give this one an Ono. The sauce was delicious, and the rice was a good consistency - not too sticky, too dry or too loose. Now if only they had a salmon/fish bowl.<br><br>I did not try the masubi (too full), but that is definitely the yardstick by with I would measure their Hawaiian Index. If it's good, I'll change my review to a 5 star. I will definitely return again!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=nX-vsteREeaJhiFIa-pQ9w

Mama Kim Cooks,"Roseville, CA",11/18/2013,4,"I feel so conflicted about this review. <br><br>SMH. <br><br>Been here twice now. The first time was 5-star all-around. We had a large brunch party (13ish ladies + one *ahem*adorable*ahem* infant that may or may not be related to me) and they accomodated our party without a hitch. Food was on point. Service, too. (Server wasn't bad to look at either. I'm just saying.)<br><br>Second time, not so much. My dish (baked french toast) wasn't cooked completely. I was only able to eat a few bites of it. Service not so hot either. Infant still cute as hell tho. <br><br>Saving grace? The band. Oh my, the band. For a music whore like myself this could save probably ANY meal (except for that Yard House steak that one time...*shivers*....). Just three guys: a guitarist, an amazing pianist who plays blind better than I EVER could with full sight, and Phillip, the restaurant co-owner slash trio's lead vocalist.<br><br>There's something about enjoying a mimosa to a jazzy live rendition of Dock Of The Bay that just sets your soul (and tummy) to feeling right. <br><br>Go.

Mama Kim Cooks,"Folsom, CA",12/9/2014,1,"As you read this review please keep in mind this is about their catering business, as I see many of these reviews are not, even though that's the Mama Kim Cooks business. Mama Kim Cooks catered my wedding this past October. I don't even know where to start with how upsetting the entire experience was. Please note that this is my ONLY 'bad review' I have ever given on Yelp. I do not believe in bad mouthing businesses. Please also note that this review comes after hearing NOTHING back from the staff here after my mom and I wrote a letter giving them ample time to make right what they did, but a month has passed and we have heard nothing and I feel this is the only way for me to feel I have some power left in this situation. <br>First I'll state what everyone else has, the food is excellent. And that was a reason we ignored some of the 'red flags' in the beginning because we really loved their food. Some of the red flags was poor communication as their coordinator Annie would take WEEKS to answer our emails or my questions, whereas all my other vendors would respond within days. That's fine, in the beginning, but as your wedding gets closer, trust me you will want questions answered more quickly. For example THE DAY OF MY WEDDING Annie emailed me 'explaining' why they would be increasing the total bill( 500$) as my wedding venue told them they could absolutely NOT arrive the time of the wedding to start. Excuse me but why would a catering company think it was ever okay to arrive when the guests did? All my friends in the restaurant business told me that is unheard of. So I talk to my parents (yep the DAY OF MY WEDDING I'm discussing this because they are the most unorganized company I have ever seen) We decide to just let it go and not waste our precious time on worrying about something we feel we can't control. Okay fine, <br><br>Now it's dinner time. We had a buffet and paid for 150 people to eat dinner, which included my DJ, two photographers, and all guests of course. We paid for 150 people to have chicken, pork, veggies, cornbread (which we paid extra PER person for), cheese tortellini, and salad, which all tasted great. But 18 of our guests only had a dinner consisting of ONE slice of pork, corn bread and tortellini because they ran out of food. EIGHTEEN OF MY GUESTS. Not one or two people. The BEST part is when my mother went to pay her and asked if they could compensate us  for the EIGHTEEN people (THREE FULL TABLES) that did not get the full meals we paid for, she was so rude, it still infuriates me weeks later. Blaming my guests for going back for seconds or taking too big of portions, AS IF MY GUESTS SHOULD KNOW HOW MUCH FOOD THERE IS? Is this lady insane? and by lady I am speaking of Mama Kim herself who was the one who was incredibly rude to my parents. I have read other reviews on here about her demeanor and this lady is horrible. She is lucky her food is so good because she would never survive in business with her poor customer service skills. <br>So not only did we pay an additional 500$ (as we were informed that day), 18 of our guests didn't get the meal we paid for them to have. <br>Now let's talk about bartenders. I enjoy bars often actually, and a great bartender is the best. These two people, YELLED at my MOH for asking for champagne for her and I before the wedding, mind you all the alcohol was bought privately by my husband and I and Mama Kim's did not supply a drop. After the wedding several of my friends told me the bartenders were incredibly rude and looked miserable to be there. I hate that my guests, who are people my husband and I hold so close to our hearts, were treated like this. Maybe these bartenders knew and hated us in a past life, because they freely gave away all our alcohol when the wedding was over. As one of my best friends recalled their words specifically were, 'Once we are done, it's free to take'. Who the HELL do you people think you are? My husband and I didn't get any of the left over wedding wine or champagne. Thankfully many of our guests who did take some in the moment, brought it to us the next day, but how embarrassing. I feel like I paid 6,500$ for a bunch of street thugs who possess no manners or common sense, to cater our wedding. I hope no bride goes through what we went through with these people! Lot's of places have great food. It's not worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=P7ww78BthQ_SMrG0QE5O8Q

Mama Kim Cooks,"Dixon, CA",10/22/2013,5,"This is a review of their catering service. We used them for our June 15th wedding. I must say I am a bit of an organized, control freak and I LOVE food. So choosing the food was the most important thing to me, after my dress! I could not be any happier with my choice to go with Mama Kim's. They were recommended to me by a friend who used them at her wedding a couple years prior, as well as a client of mine who uses them for any family event. <br><br>The food was delicious!!! 10 out of 10. Everyone complimented us on the food, and there was nothing left. <br><br>But Steve, the coordinator was AMAZING!! He is what sealed the deal for us!<br>He was my favorite vendor to work with. He was very easy to communicate with, he always answered my emails or phone calls quickly and was always there to help.<br>We met with him at their restaurant where we were treated to a dinner to try their cuisine and we loved almost everything. We decided right then and there to book them for our wedding. We just clicked with Steve, and we felt he completely understand what we were going for.<br><br>Steve went over menu options with us that fit the style of our wedding, our taste and our budget. He also coordinated all of our rentals for us as our venue provided nothing - we needed tables, linens, place setting, silverware, chairs, umbrellas, etc... Steve ordered everything; his staff set it all up and broke it down the day of our wedding. <br>You can easily tell he was very experienced and gave us great advice on our wedding in general. He also took the time to come to our venue with me, as he had never worked an event there, to see the layout and setup. He was also great about communicating with our venue and other vendors to ensure everyone was on the same page and everything would flow smoothly. <br>We provided our own alcohol and hired their bartender, he was a tremendous help in letting us know how much we should purchase and what would pair best with the food they were preparing. He was even there himself on the day of our wedding, working the carving station. It was so nice to see him there! I knew that everything would be taken care of, as if I were doing it myself. <br><br>I would HIGHLY recommend Mama Kim Cooks and Steve to anyone and everyone looking for catering. Everything from the planning, the service and the food were top notch!<br><br>On a side note: we loved the vibe and food at the restaurant as well when we went for our tasting. We can't wait to go back for brunch or dinner and relive the delicious food of our wedding, and hopefully see Steve!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rVAPGcgfz9VlBhMxJMspkw

The vegetables were perfectly fired roasted which really became more of the star of this dish.  Don't think it's worth the $13.<br>I have a Coworker who is of Peruvian decent and grew up in Peru and this Peruvian fries doesn't come close to authentic.<br>l also wondered if this was a variation of a Vietnamese Cube steak onion and peppers.<br> l may have better luck with their sandwiches next time.<br>Service is 0k.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0rWhDmqOYIT-sno-rfTuVA

It was crisp on the outside, and moist and cheesy on the inside. But not too much of anything. There was just enough cheese, the flavor and texture of the noodles was there, and it was delicious.<br>I never thought I'd say it, but the salad may have been even better. Firm, juicy, and sweet cubes of watermelon, accompanied by thin slices of jalapeno, onion, and I think feta cheese. It was bursting with flavors, textures, and was perfectly refreshing.

Hefty Gyros,"Bakersfield, CA",3/23/2016,5,"OK....this place is legit. If you haven't read my other reviews of Mediterranean style cuisine, I'm always on the quest for the best gyros I can find. It's one of my favorite foods and I'm Greek, so I've tried a bunch. Anyways, I saw this place at food truck mania in West Sac tonight and thought I would give it a whirl. Thank god I did!!!!<br><br>First of all, the guy on register was super sweet! Great customer service. Second, the gyro and fries were on point. I had the traditional gyro and it was so flavorful. Great use of spices and sauce. Omnomnom. Then I had fries that seemed like they had some sort of tzatziki and sriracha on them? I'm not sure if that was exactly it but they were also delicious and spicy in a hot kinda way. Loved it. It is probably the second best gyro I've ever had.

Hefty Gyros,"Elk Grove, CA",3/2/2016,5,"2 words: HEFTY FRIES<br><br>If you're ever at the Hefty Gyros truck, get the hefty fries and get ready for the most insanely delicious meal of your life. The crispy crinkle cut fries are topped with tzatziki sauce, this red sauce (not quite sure what it is) and TONS of meat. Definitely hefty. <br><br>The gyros are also amazing but the hefty fries are unlike anything I've ever tasted before. Their meat is more minced rather than the traditional strip that gyro meat is usually in which definitely sets it apart from other gyro spots.<br><br>I usually get the traditional gyro meat (a mixture of lamb and beef) for my Pita and Hefty fries but I was sharing some things with my mom tonight at Elk Grove Food Truck Mania and she doesn't eat beef so we had to get both the fries and pita with chicken. Initally, I was bummed but decided to try it out. Safe to say, I WAS NOT dissapointed! The chicken was amazing and all the flavors in the pita and fries went together so well. My mom and I are both in agreement that this was one of the most delicious meals we have ever had. <br><br>Also, the customer service is excellent! The gentleman who took my order (didn't get his name) was so nice and even gave me a free soda when I went back to get a second pita (no shame.)

El Ajicito Food Truck,"Sacramento, CA",12/18/2015,5,"I am SO glad to have randomly found El Ajicito! Their food truck was parked in front of New Helvetia Brewing; since I'm a fan of food trucks and haven't heard of them before (and since I was intrigued to find out what ""Peruvian street food"" was) I decided to give them a try. I ordered the chicharron sandwich and the salchipapas. The lady who took my order was super friendly and my food was ready in less than 5 minutes- score!<br><br>The food... you guys, THE FOOD. The chicharron was deep fried pork with sweet potatoes mixed in with the other burger fixings. I didn't know how that taste combo would work but let me tell you, it works perfectly. My favorite was the salchipapas which was fried hot dog bits over french fries, with cheese and some of the most delicious condiments I've ever had- 2 different creamy savory sauces, one was a little sweet and the other was a little spicy. I guarantee I will get the salchipapas at any future visit to El Ajicito, they were SO damn good!<br><br>I highly recommend El Ajicito, give them a try if you see the truck!

The onions were cut way too thin and the tomatoes weren't sautéed enough, both of which add tremendous value to the traditional dish, since they absorb the juices and are released as you're enjoying every bite (this dish lacked it in every sense). It also seemed as if the meat was precooked, which is never good with steak and it had a funny seasoning I couldn't put my finger on. The fries and portion were ok.

I was full after my meal but still was tempted to order more things off the menu just to try them. The people working there were very friendly, and when we didn't go back outside to get our food in time, someone came in and brought it to us so we could enjoy it hot.

I ordered the Angus Sliders ($7) &amp; an order of Garlic Fries ($6). Both looked fresh &amp; smelled yum-o!

Everything on the receipt matched up to what I was told my charge would be.<br>I'll have to check my bank account tomorrow to make sure, but I'm not too concerned.<br> <br>The slider was really tasty. The bun was soft, slightly chewy. The veggies were fresh &amp; the beef was seasoned just right. I know some had complained about them being too salty. I did not find that to be the case. The garlic fries were really terrific. Chunky &amp; fresh, not too greasy. The chopped garlic definitely did not look like the kind I get out of the jar from Costco! Due to some delays I wasn't able to eat my fries for about a 1/2 hour after I bought them. With the delay, I felt they held up well, still some crispness to them &amp; not greasy.<br><br>All in all I would say it was a good experience &amp; if they come back again, i will definitely try them again!

To start with the service was awful, I don't know if the girl at the counter was the owners daughter but she had no idea what she was doing.  My husband had to repeat his order at least five times;  it was only two sandwiches and an order of fries.  Keep in mind, the menu had max 12 items on it.  I left half way thru, got in line for beer and my husband didn't join me for another five minutes.  We got a table, sat down and began the hour wait for our food.  We were joined at our table by a family and began talking about what number our order was. They had number six, we were number one 30 minutes earlier they were calling 91.  As time went on one of the ladies sitting with us went up to check on her order and brought back my sandwich; which really wasn't my sandwich.  The person in the truck told her this was for order one, but it was sliders not a regular burger.  Whatever, I've  been waiting close to an hour, I took it.  We were still missing my husbands tri-tip sandwich and our fries.  10 minutes later we got the fries and 10 minutes later we got his sandwich.  Meanwhile the nice ladies next to us got half of their order. As far as the food, it may have been the fact that I was so irritated about waiting that it didn't taste good but really the sliders were over-cooked and super salty, the fries were mediocre and my husband only ate half his sandwich.  The whole experience was seriously awful, I would not recommend New Bite to anyone.  They really need to get a plan and work on their customer service.  I know owning your own business is difficult but without a good reputation you're never gonna make any money.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8um-Q5i4ED5UrXsqAtBZKQ

It was $5 for the 2 tacos and $5 for the bottled soda.  Major rip-off and major disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4MdC2I0ulR2rS4CaHU0BlA
Azteca Street Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",9/20/2016,2,"I see this food truck all the time and have always wanted to try it. I was so disappointed in both the quality of the food and the price. We ordered a chicken and cheese quesadilla, carnitas nachos, and two tacos. The chicken was flavorless and just had a very unappealing taste. I couldn't understand why my kids weren't eating it and after tasting it I don't blame them.   Both the chicken taco and the quesadilla went uneaten. The carnitas meat on the nachos was just alright, but the steak was much better hence the 2 star review. Overall, we were so dissatisfied with the quality of the food and the price that we wouldn't even attempt a second visit.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZDHm2Z5WWJyku4k_ZfZj4w

Ordered 4 asada (assassin) and 2 carnitas (cardiac arrested) tacos. ALL were dry including the tortillas. Disappointed cause I had high hopes as the truck looks stylish with the vehicle wrap and all. Maybe should invest in getting better quality meats and marinades. I will keep driving next time. Thank goodness for the sangria (non alcoholic) I bought with the tacos. Enjoy at your own risk!

I tried their quesadilla and was excited to try more but had to leave. Well, I tracked them down again at Track 7 brewery. The chicharones in their fresh tortillas was to die for.

I've been dying to try their tacos, since I follow them on the gram, and I must say I was pretty pleased. Their takes on authentic cuisine are pretty spot on. I got the sampler with Jamaica. The sampler I chose consisted of their three proteins beef, chicken and pork. The pork in chile verde was my favorite, secondly the ""tinga"" chicken and lastly the beef. The beef was in some pseudo-birria sauce, ugh this could be so wrong, but just more tomato-y? It was pretty salty too; I wish it had more pzzas and it would have definitely taken me there. The price was great, the service was fast and I love it when the Jamaica is not too sweet. Overall, I love what MASA brings.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yGpyO9s2kXenVZi9i936Xw

Masa Guisería,"Sacramento, CA",5/18/2017,5,"Out on a recent beer drinking outing we came across these wonderful folks at Flatland Brewing. We arrived as they were setting up and had a quick conversation on the way in to grab a beer. They were very friendly and gave us a quick rundown on what they did. It sounded like we were in for some solid tacos and we ended up with that and so much more. At first I was a little taken back at the price. Three tacos for $10.50 seemed steep. I confess I love tacos on the cheap like anyone else. Looking at the menu it was clear these weren't your average pedestrian mass produced tacos. We ordered up and headed back to our table when the nice young lady said she would be happy to bring our meals over to us when they were ready. In short order we had two taco trios to go with our tasty beers. <br><br>They make their own tortillas and press them fresh to order. My first bite was the braised beef shoulder with pickled onions and fresh cilantro. I was expecting a flavor explosion, but it wasn't there, instead the savory goodness of a well braised meat, properly seasoned with judicious use of the pickled onion and cilantro totally wowed me into submission. The fresh tortilla was excellent in taste and texture and provided the perfect foundation. I could hardly wait to take my next bite. In short order that taco was polished off and it was on to the next one. The shredded chicken with chipotle and chorizo was another delicious taco. The avocado salsa and the queso fresco all married together in a way that once again, no component shined above another. A perfect balance of flavors. I was excited to get to the final taco, and again was very impressed. The Chili Verde was very nicely done. The dice was more fine than expected, which worked out exceptionally well for a taco. The tomatillos, onions and garlic wove to another excellent balance of flavors. The cool crema was a nice contrast to the filling. Not sure where the recipes come from, but they were all so delicious. It makes me wonder if they are recipes that were handed down and subsequently elevated just a bit. Whatever the back story, trifecta of amazing taco goodness for the win! <br><br>I looked these folks up right away on social media. They are very active on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. The currently operate in a pop up tent but there truck is nearly complete. They know what a quality taco is all about and I could not be more excited to check them out again when the truck is rolling! Then again I may not be able to wait that long.

Masa Guisería,"Placerville, CA",1/21/2018,5,"I. LOVE. TACOS. This has been a short biography of my life. Seriously, I recently went on over to the old watering hole (Track 7) for some new brews they were releasing over the weekend. My son was with me and we were hungry. As luck would have it, Masa Guiseria was right there in the parking lot ready and willing to feed the masses, and that's exactly what they did. I was super pleased when my order was ready to see the fresh made tortillas and the super saucy filling. We shared 2 beef and 2 pork glorious tacos. Scarfed them down in no time and then used the supplied fork to suck down any leavings that fell into the paper boat they arrived in. They know what they are doing because, you WILL need both the fork and the boat. A bib may be in order as well. Oh man... I'm not sure how many of those I could eat, but I would be embarrassed to offer an estimate. Bottom line, if you see this truck on the freeway, follow it until it stops (not at a stoplight you stalker) at an establishment and then order up a batch of fresh heaven.

Ma Sarap Food Truck,"Carmichael, CA",9/6/2017,4,"I tried Ma Sarap at an Off The Grid event in Davis. Their menu included photos of the entrees, which is helpful for anyone not familiar with the different items offered. I chose the pork sisig, which came with a side of the pancit (noodles) and white rice. The meat was moderately spicy and a little heavy on the salt, but still good when mixed with the plain rice. The slices of chili pepper on top of the meat were a bit too hot so I picked some of those out. I also tried the lumpia, thin and crispy fried rolls of meat, which were very tasty. Some of the prices were a little spendy ($2 for a bottle of water or can of soda!) but I'd probably eat here again some day.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=658ZoCdZY7pnDEdvVLFMuw

Vegetable lumpia should not be made with frozen vegetables, period! Such a disappointment. I have had better vegetable lumpia from a frozen food section. Corn does not belong in a lumpia and the lumpia was oily. We had to soak up four napkins of oil from two lumpias. Please revamp your vegetable lumpia and make sure the oil is hot, so the lumpia doesn't absorb oil. I would get the adobe and sigsig. Avoid the lumpia. Overall, 2.95 stars.

YES! I was in love.  It was the perfect balance of so many strong and delicious flavors.  This is by far the best taco I have ever had.  I then realized I had the Porky and made love to the other creating a menage a trois of deliciousness. I swallowed the final pieces and realized it was over.  I lit a cigarette, and sat back in my love seat, breathing in the experience I just had.  The next day I started looking for this pimp disguised as a truck.  I wanted more shrimps and porkies!  I started looking online, then walked the streets looking at every corner.  This truck was nowhere to be seen.  I finally went to it's daddy, Krush, and they told me this pimp was dead.  I miss it.  The name Krave is so fitting, because I Krave these meaty, juicy, tacos every night, as I hug myself to sleep.  Please come back, even for a day.  I long for that moment of ecstasy once more.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IKiNRR_JaUi5KSwr_v7fDQ

Crave Food Truck,"Sacramento, CA",,4,I tried the Ninja taco this pas weekend at the Trucktoberfest.  I have to say this taco was amazing!!! I highly disagree with the other review.  The Korean beef was so flavorful and they give you a good amount of it. The meat is from Korean short ribs that has been cut up into bite sized portions.  The tortilla shell was nice and thin and the asian slaw on top added the perfect amount of crunch and spice to the incredible tasting meat. The taco was only $4 and larger then a typical taco.  I highly recommend Crave Food Truck.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KGqI3yiTPNMf1C7moDz2RA

Overall I was extremely satisfied with their services.  The one thing that I think some other reviewers mentioned is that their communication via email can be quite slow, but I found that I was always able to call Annie via phone and reach her with no problems.  <br><br>Annie was my go-to person and she is genuinely very sweet.  I felt very comfortable talking with her and we went through the estimated bill together and were able to rent items through their restaurant, rather than a party rental company and save some money. Their pricing was quite reasonable and they also built me a custom menu to fit my needs, as my husband's family is mostly vegetarian/vegan.  I had two appetizers, and about 5 dishes for a brunch wedding, as well as beverages including coffee, tea, lemonade for about ~$24/person.  The day of the wedding went very smoothly, they came and set up around the back of the venue and brunch was ready to start right on time.  I don't recall any issues the entire day, except that there were not labels for each food item.  For me this was not a big deal, but we did have one dish that had meat in it, so that is important to keep in mind for vegetarians/vegans. <br><br>I would use them again in a hearbeat for my next catering event.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_b-DmDgjCOSG8T1xby02ZA

I haven't had them in a couple of years. I finally caught them at CalPers last Friday. I guess they have a set menu now...and I am so glad. I tried their fish tacos with their sweet potato chips... OMG so good. I was in heaven. The fish tacos were the best I had ever had - even better than when I went to Cabo. And the chips were amazing too! I really was tempted to return for more that same day but I was full!! As a matter of fact, I am sitting here wishing for more. Especially, since the food truck I just tried was quite the opposite experience today and am sitting here hungry. :(  Hoping Mama Kim returns SOON!!

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Sacramento, CA",11/2/2015,1,"My fiance and I have been looking for a food truck to cater our wedding next May 2016. We searched multiple places online and found 3 local trucks that we wanted to try before making our final decision. Flavor face being one of my favorite looking menus! <br><br>Finding this food truck proved to be pretty difficult. At first that seemed kind of ""cool."" But became a little frustrating. I ended up calling the flavor face truck 3 times and didn't get a call back. I called a fourth and finally got in touch with somebody. They said they would be out in Roseville for the last concert with Sactomofo. Awesome! Finally! I rounded up some friends and family and headed out to Roseville. We had high hopes of ordering one of everything on the menu and trying it all out. Low and behold, NO SHOW! Needless to say, I was very upset.<br><br>I called 2 more times and no answer and no call back. I found out they were supposed to be downtown at Sutter for lunch last week. My fiance agreed to give them another chance. We headed out for lunch and NO FREAKIN SHOW!<br><br>If I can't get in touch with these guys or find them when they are scheduled to be somewhere, how does this show how our ""Big Day"" is going to go.

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Rancho Cordova, CA",7/16/2015,5,"Flavor Face has to be one of my favorite food trucks. Yesterday, at the Folsom Food Truck event at Lions Park, I had the pleasure of trying the food from Flavor Face. Having been a weekly regular at the Tuesday event at Anatolia, I have eaten at almost all of the other trucks there. I had never come across Flavor Face before and was intrigued by the menu. It was simple in a good way. The way that conveyed a sense of ""we focus on these 8 or so items"" rather than a whole bunch of different items. <br><br>I ordered a French drip burger, chicken philly and hot link fries. <br><br>The burger was outstanding. To paraphrase the gentleman from the truck - it's a take on a burger and French onion soup combined.  The flavor was on point and I loved how the beef patty felt when I ate it. It melted in my mouth. If the patty wasn't hand formed, it sure seemed like it was. <br><br>My wife had the chicken philly but I stole a few bites. It was also terrific. Just the right amount of pepper to pass along flavor and some heat with out overdoing it. <br><br>The hot link fries were also very good but they are more of a meal on thief own rather than a side of fries. <br><br>Bonus- the burger and sandwich cans with what I suspect are homemade potato chips. Also very good. <br><br>Overall I was extremely impressed with this truck and look forward to sampling the other items they offer.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=n3bzK0GGhPZ1n5uYMC4vPw

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Sacramento, CA",10/16/2014,3,"I order the tough, but easy Char Siu Pork Belly Slider, easy because I am Asian descent and my family is known for roasted meats. I did not like this sandwich. First, it was advertised, ""Char Siu Pork ""Belly"" Sandwich"" but I discovered the cut to be a Boston Butt; No way was that cut a pork belly. The slider was like $8.00 with house chips. Kinda steep for a Boston Butt. When I chomped down on that slider, I had noticed notes of sour, salty and sweet. In my honest opinion, it was not a good symphony and not well balanced. The Char Siu Pork ""Butt"" (I would of just called it a Char Siu Pork Sandwich as Char Siu is typically made with a Boston Butt) Sandwich is 2/5 at most.<br><br>I also order the Soft Shell Crab sandwich. That was nice. But I think the slaw killed it. The slaw and the butter of the soft shell crab did not go in harmony, although different and tasty, I think something needs to change here.<br><br>My final verdict is this truck is, ""aight"". In the vehicular of the Anglo-Saxons, this truck is mediocre. I believe the chef himself has some things he needs to work on and needs to pay more attention on how his meal presents itself on the palate. Other than that, this guy can become a new Sacramentian top chef.<br><br>On a good note... They have this Green Garlic Hot Sauce that I like. Shiza is fuego. I suspect it is a tomatillo based. That shiza has a kick that your mama would have felt and scream your full American name.<br><br>Food for the Brain: Soft Shell Crab is also known as the blue crab. It is an invasive species of America, suspected to be brought here by South East Asians.<br><br>Kay S - You should read my Taco Bell comment again. It was a joke review for laughs. A MC chicken at Taco Bell? You are smart. And why so defensive? Did you get paid to boost the rating and is your report bias? Are you related to this business or the guy who modeled this business for Flavor Face, who is ironically based in LA, which you are from? This is Yelp and this is my review.

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Sacramento, CA",7/27/2015,1,"What a huge disappointment. Note that this review is for their catering, not the food alone. The food is great, which prompted us to inquire about them catering our wedding next May (we're having several trucks provide all the food for a fun, cocktail style reception). At first, Brian (chef) was super excited to participate and had a ""sky's the limit"" attitude when it came to food options. It quickly became clear, however, that he could not handle the business side of things. He would take weeks to respond to e-mails, we would set up tasting dates and he would bail, etc. etc. <br><br>Then along came his girlfriend, Michelle (who wrote their first review on Yelp, by the way - classy), who was going to handle all the e-mail and contract negotiations for us. She was much more responsive, seemingly organized, and pretty helpful. That is until about four months went by and we still didn't have a contract. She had given us a per person cost, but balked when we asked for a breakdown including tax, setup, etc. - basically anything that a real contract would include.<br><br>At this point, Michelle started making up excuses, not responding to e-mails/text messages, and behaving rather oddly. I got the sense that she and Brian had either broken up, or were simply backing out of the catering idea but not willing to tell us. It took multiple phone calls and e-mails from our wedding planner and myself before she finally responded with a short ""Sorry, we won't be able to cater your wedding"" e-mail. Months of e-mails, calls, and shooting menus back and forth and working toward a contract, and then a short e-mail backing out. How terribly unprofessional. Never mind the previous unprofessional things that I had been willing to overlook, like her accidentally texting me things meant for Brian, and their complete disregard for timelines, e-mail etiquette, and schedule commitments. That they couldn't produce an actual contract also makes me wonder about their integrity and ability to honestly come up with a price for their food and services.<br><br>In short, there is absolutely no infrastructure in this company to handle catering as their name suggests, and I would warn anyone pursuing them that it is not worth the headache and stress. After many months of being led on, I can confidently say that your money and time are better spent elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yzIL0RSYuLyngVAQSGfvcg

And I was concerned about what looked to basically be ranch all over the special fries I ordered. But after trying them, it is more than just ranch (although likely a prominent ingredient). It presented with a mild sweetness similar to cream. And balanced well with the seasoning used and sriracha sauce, which added a pleasant but mild heat. Overall, pretty damn good fries.

They added "steak on a bed of rice" and I won't lie. I have been eating it everyday since they added it to the menu. Hefty Gyros at Beale AFB is the most delicious food around. I thought i was crazy that is until I brought a plate of it to my GF. She now has me bring a plate of "Steak and rice" every friday before I leave work at Beale AFB.

My wife had the falafel on rice and I had the hefty fries, and we shared a baklava for dessert. Each item was awesome. For mine the fries were perfect, meat was delicious, and it had the perfect amount of red and white sauce. My only change would be chopping the peppers put on top a bit finer. My wife's dish was amazing as well. It initially looked like they went overboard on the sauce, but once it was stirred in it was the perfect amount.

It gave the chicken an added flavor dimension. Yum. The sandwich was priced at $9. <br><br>I also ordered a side of fries. $4. The fries were seasoned with csalt.

It is still held every Friday evening at Cesar Chavez Park between 10th and 11th and I and J Streets. Parking is not available at the event, but you can easily walk from light rail or downtown offices. <br><br>The event is free for everyone. This is a nice benefit to the region allowing for a nice open air concert. Being outside can be a gamble. A beautiful delta breeze one week can turn into a smoggy heat wave the next. The music is eclectic and usually fun for the audience ranging from babies to the elderly all enjoying the music. <br><br>Unfortunately, the food and drink options have deteriorated. The event is now sponsored by Budweiser so the drinks are all industrial brews, although they have some Bogle wine and limited cocktails. Food is also limited to a few food trucks with the typical greasy and meat heavy options popular in the suburbs. <br><br>The token system is a bit weird in an era of square and Apple Pay. Fortunately the portable toilets were clean, and La Cosecha is open too. Seating can be tough with limited grass space, but the fountain is run in again acting as a weak mister for the area. <br><br>Live music is always nice, especially in Downtown Sacramento.

It was three dollars for one pork tamale but they were substantial and very flavorful.<br><br>I knew that James Cavern was headlining the night so he would be playing last. Wasn't sure if we would make the entire night but yes we were there for a majority of it. Current Personae and Tessa Evans were amazing to listen and dance to though we left the dancing to Kenny the dancing Sacramento guy.  If you were there you would know what I mean. DJ Epik kept us entertained in between acts.<br><br>What was really on point was James brought out the previous performers to sing with him. He even had local talented Inland where Cindy sang so beautifully! Yeah! Love outdoors live music. It was actually the kind of music I love listening to.

They do have portapotties too. <br>If you live close by and have a bike then bike down here as they have a place for you to park your bike. That's so smart as parking can be a pain though we really lucked out!!! Last night was the opening night of the season. It's every Friday from May to July 2016.

It's only $5 after 5pm which is great! I would recommend getting here early before it gets really packed. My only negative would be that there isn't really too much for kids to do.

India Jones,"Sacramento, CA",10/6/2018,2,"Man, I was excited to try this when I stumbled upon it at Denios but it was disappointing. First off, a white lady was working the shack all by herself. Serving up Indian food. I found it to be kinda odd but hey- as long as the food is good, who cares?! But it wasn't. I got the masala fries and the chicken Frankie. The frozen French fries were dropped fresh but was doused in too much masala powder. And came with ketchup. I think switching to a more interesting dip or Indian style sauce would make those fries on point! I moved on to the Frankie which came out after the fries cuz she's only one person and can only do so much at the same time! I honestly thought the chicken was going to make me ill because it just tasted ... not fresh. It was a let down. If the chicken would have been fresh with some diced onions, seasoned cucumbers and tomatoes it would have been hella good! With a side of green chutney sauce. But that's not what you get. Hope the business owner takes these suggestions to heart cuz that stand could be the <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&amp;s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bomb.com</a>. Get the poor lady more help tho so she can keep up with the line. It wasn't long by any means but she could only do one thing at a time. Also, the location is in a strange tight spot too. It's in the produce area so I was blocking the watermelon stand while I was standing and waiting. I may try again the next time I go to denios but only if I see a crowd cuz maybe the food may be fresher. If so, I'll update my review.

Masa Guisería,"Valencia, CA",6/21/2016,1,"This is in reply to the response from Alex at Masa. Neither me, nor my husband, are friends with the owners of Guisados. We have met the owner and his son because they are also a family run business, and therefore we have seen them while patronizing their establishments. Never, ever, not even once, have we socialized with the owners of Guisados outside of that. To blame my review on that is in poor taste. Rather you can behave like a mature adult, take constructive criticism, and grow from it. Try to make improvements. Learn from feedback. You'll need to have much thicker skin if you plan on surviving this restaurant game. Not everyone is going to love your food. You won't always impress. People have different experiences in life. Different tastes. Different expectations. I'm sorry I was your first negative review. I'm sure I won't be your last. And, by the way, I find it interesting that you accuse me of writing a biased review for a friend, when your friends have obviously reviewed you, since the reviewers know you by name, your work history, background info, etc. They even jumped to your defense once I wrote my review, writing good reviews and sending me private comments. Interesting double standard. Again, I'm in no way associated with Guisados. I just love good tacos and good food in general. I used to be a food blogger, and as you can see by my Yelp page, I review many restaurants with a wide variety of ratings. My husband is from LA, but Mexican and Honduran by blood, and the man loves tacos almost as much as he loves me, so we scour every area looking for the best. As far as other social media, I've never even commented or posted on any of your social media sites, unless ""liking"" your pics counts. My husband tagged Guisados on one of your Instagram photos, that's it. And you have since blocked us. Is this the harassment of which you speak? If you were confident in your products and its authenticity and originality, you'd have no reason to be so defensive.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WII18mn-4xAj4vYMg2CAVg

I ordered the combo meal, which came with spaghetti carbonara, zuppa toscana, cannoli, and a drink.<br><br>It was all amazing. The spaghetti noodles were very filling, and their flavor was incredible. Since I had ordered carbonara, the noodles were coated in tiny bits of scrambled eggs, prosciutto, tomato, shaved cheese, oil, and spices. Every single bite was perfect. My grandma was really good at cooking Italian food, and this tasted like something she would have made. <br><br>Zuppa toscana is normally not my favorite, but theirs won me over. I don't think it was supposed to come with the combo, but they were out of salad, so I just got lucky. <br><br>The cannoli was fresh. Even in Italian delis, it's hard to find cannoli this good. <br><br>Another reviewer complained about the portions. While it is true that the portions were a bit smaller than, say, Olive Garden, the difference in taste was more than worth it. Plus, it was still way more than enough food for one meal. I could barely finish it all, and I had just been hiking.<br><br>I hate to be *that* Yelper, but-- I'm Italian, so, you can trust me on this one.

I almost didn't want to share with my husband. Next time we'll order two! The sweet potato chips were a nice accompaniment as well.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xHh1somQutvjHMvgdgeyVg
Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",9/16/2011,4,"Saw the truck in Natomas on my way back to work with a sandwich I had just bought for lunch. Since I have never seen them in this area, I decided to save the sandwich for dinner and try Mama Kims while I had the chance. I had the tri tip sandwich with sweet potato chips. <br>I love tri tip and this was the best I have ever had, really. Medium rare but very tender. I don't know how they get it that tender and yet still med rare. Slaw on the sandwich mixed great with the tri tip and fresh roll. Big sandwich with lots of meat makes it worth the $10. Loved the sweet potato chips, a little oily but still crisp and great taste.<br>I hope they come out to Natomas more often. They may need to try the Phoenix Univ location for bigger crowds.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=P0twOehBiWcQ2Qaq_OwaYg

Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",9/4/2011,4,"Experienced Mama Kim's Food truck when they catered an event I attended and it was very nice.  When I heard Mama Kim's I was expecting Asian Food but was pleasantly surprised with equally tasty selections of the non-Asian variety. The purple truck served up four lunch entrees for the group with tasty accompaniments. The choices included chicken salad, Turkey and Brie on a biscuit, a Tri-tip  Sando and one other. The tri-tip and Turkey and Brie seemed to be the most popular although I heard no complaints as people tried all the delicious choices. The Turkey and Brie with mixed greens on a biscuit was a upscale twist on the turkey and cheese sandwich. It was served with a pear and walnut salad with a unique addictive dressing.The biscuit reminded me of a served cold, heartier R*d Lobst*r biscuit when you laid eyes on it.  I dunked the biscuit sandwich in the dressing to give it more moisture. D-lish! (See Amy J's photo as that image is spot on.) The tri-tip got accolades with it's slaw and sweet potato fried chips by many as well. The hungry lunch crowd was fed and happy in a timely fashion. I would definitely try them again if they were at a location I was at.  Give them a go!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=q00wVQ32ZULDJYsdAw1tgA
Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",4/9/2013,5,"This is a review of their catering service.  We used Mama Kim Cooks as the caterer for our wedding.  They were great!  Reasons:<br><br>1. The food was delicious.  We tried their food at the restaurant beforehand and enjoyed it, and we weren't disappointed with the cuisine for our wedding reception.  Many guests remarked on how yummy the food was.<br>2. The coordinator, Steve Lach, was great.  We met with him about what we wanted, and he worked within our budget to produce a menu to our liking.  He's also very experienced with weddings, and he provided us with good general advice on receptions and schedules.<br>3. He was great about communicating with the DJ, wedding day coordinator, and other vendors to make sure everyone was on the same page and that things were running smoothly.<br>4. We had a last minute hiccup where we realized that we needed more ice for the bar -- this was on the morning of our wedding!  I called Steve Lach, and he got it for us, no problem.<br>5. I didn't know that Steve was going to actually be working at our reception, but when I (groom) was getting food from the buffet and reached the end, and I saw him manning the tri-tip station -- it was so reassuring to see his friendly face.  It was like seeing an old friend!<br><br>When planning a wedding, we learned that you want to use vendors that are trustworthy and experienced -- it makes the planning process, and the actual wedding day, much easier.  Mama Kim Cooks, and Steve Lach, were great!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Twe0QQ3OweATKBnkN9EwhQ

Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",3/30/2012,2,"The truck parks on 9th and O Street on Tuesday's.The first time I tried their Thai Noodle Salad and it was awesome. On the same visit the board stated they had chocolate chip cookies. I ordered one and when I got back to my office, I took it out of the bag. It was Oatmeal Raisin! I hate raisins but I didn't want to go back to the truck. The following week I went back but the truck was a no-show! Then I went the following week and the guy said they were not there the previous week because they were exhausted from working the Labor Day weekend. Well they didn't have the noodle salad so I ordered the tomato soup. They forgot to heat it up so I had to wait.  It was ok. Then I went on 9/20/11 and no show again!! So this past Tuesday they showed up. I ordered a portabella mushroom on ciabatta... Without cheese. While the guy is fixing it he tells me they ran out of avocado (or did they forget?) ; no offer of price reduction. I did get BBQ chips. In the beginning the sandwiches came with sweet potato fries. They don't have that anymore! So I get back to the office a little miffed as the sandwich w/o cheese and avocado cost $8! Then I tried the sandwich and the bread was stale! I ate the mushroom, roasted pepper and chips and threw the bread away. No more Mama Kim for me! They have raised their prices by a dollar since the end of August.  They are not dependable as you don't know if they will show up or not. Their website doesn't show any information.

Not the best falafel I have had, but not the worst. Somewhere in the middle. The rice was cooked well, but it was plain and hard to mix in with the rest of the meal. It also made the meal dry in spite of the sauce. The salad was plain as well because it was just lettuce, nothing special. The sauce was good, but there was SO much hot sauce that it took over the meal and I had a hard time tasting any other flavors. Next time I would leave it off or ask for just a little hot sauce.<br><br>The portion was generous and enough for one person, but I found myself just eating the falafel off the top and throwing away the rice and lettuce. Boo. I would come back again to give them another try (have I mentioned I'm obsessed with falafel?) but this time get the Falafel inside a pita instead.<br><br>FALAFEL.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=2agcfynFfeeb3s0P60lwig

When paired with the garlic aioli, it tastes even better. It adds a depth of flavor and a refreshing bite to the deep-fried snack.<br><br>I also ordered the bulgogi and lemon ginger chicken, which were good, but I liked the chicken better.

There are so many food trucks nowadays that I can't keep up. Even so, this one was worth checking out. <br><br>The fried rice balls (Chinese sausage, shitake, scallion) are similar to Chinese sticky rice dumplings. I liked the creamy sauce on them. The smashed potato fries (garlic-chive sour cream, siracha ketchup, scallions), were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  It was a generous portion, but I wished it had more sauce. Both items were $2.50 each- cheap.<br><br>My friends ordered the skewer set, which came with a bulgogi beef skewer, a chicken skewer and grilled green beans. The meat skewers were tender.

Best of all, it's FREE! <br><br>Some of the amazing food trucks/vendors I've seen this year - Krush Burger, Bacon Mania, Andy's Candy, Rich's Ice Cream, Street Tacos, Joe's BBQ, Gyro 2 Go, and vendors selling kettle corn, kahlua pig sandwiches, pork belly fries, and desserts. <br><br>They have free bike valet, booths from local stations to win prizes, and a lady that makes balloons into animals/shapes for kids. Also, with your CIP wristband, you can attend many after parties in the downtown area. Some bars, clubs, and restaurants will offer happy hour prices on food or free admission. <br><br>Concert in the Park is a great place to have fun, dance to music, eat good food, or just relax on the grass (bring a picnic blanket).

We did 1/2 piggy fries (shredded pork and coleslaw) and Mac fries (Mac and cheese loaded fries!) both topped with fresh bacon pieces. Fries where crispy and hot. Both toppings were tasty and fresh.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7iBXdN0QaqxPhO8zNFzuKQ

Bacon MANia Truck,"Sacramento, CA",5/17/2017,3,"Bacon mania is some of my favorite things mixed together! The only things I've ever gotten here were the bacon and mac and the mac over fries. Both were really good. I've eaten at this truck probably 3-4 times. One time when they came to my school for lunch, they gave me the smallest portion of the bacon and mac, it's usually more but I think they were running out or being stingy that day, hence a few stars off L And another time they came to my school, they ran out of fries and the mac? Like...?<br><br> <br><br>The food-<br><br>The food is good, the mac and cheese is creamy and there is a pretty good amount of bacon in the mac. The mac over fries is pretty good as well but the fries we got were a little cold and hard once we got to the bottom so we just tossed the rest.<br><br> <br><br>The service-<br><br>I mean, it's a food truck so they're always quick. Nothing excellent or notable here but I've definitely had great service at other food trucks so I think this is somewhere bacon mania could step up.<br><br> <br><br>The location-<br><br>They've come to pretty convenient places, like my school, my job and other events that have a bunch of food trucks. I've never tried to look for them myself but I think they could be pretty accessible if you look on their social media. They did give us flyers a couple of times that we ate here. I think they could benefit from opening a brick and mortar store!<br><br> <br><br>Overall, I really do get pretty excited when I know bacon mania is going to be at an event because I usually get a bunch of things and split it with my friends or whomever I'm with. But when I'm by myself and I just get the bacon and mac, I wish that there was better service/more food so they don't' run out.

I was being inpatient big time! <br><br>Then this happened...<br><br>I was literally tearing up at Off The Grid, Fort Mason last night. My husband was walking 10 steps behind me as I circled the whole venue 3 times looking for Bacon Mania. Maybe it was because he was really searching for Bacon Mania for me or maybe he didn't want anyone to know he was with me cause I had tears rolling down my face. When I finally came to realization Bacon Mania wasn't there last night, my world had ended. Knowing I was going to die that night from starvation finally hit big time! <br><br>Every time I'm here at Off The Gird, they're here! No need to check the website!

Bacon MANia Truck,"San Francisco, CA",5/5/2016,5,"Well, you can never have too much bacon.  These guys are serious!  Bacon Mania is one of the new vendors for the 2016 season at Off The Grid Fort Mason, basically filling the void left by the Bacon Bacon Truck.  What I like about Bacon Mania is how their food is completely different from what Bacon Bacon had to offer, so there really shouldn't be any comparison with the two trucks.  In my honest opinion though, I like Bacon Mania a whole lot better!<br><br>First thing that you should know is that the majority of the menu includes their award-winning Mac n' Bacon either as a topping, a stuffing, a side, or a standalone dish.  It's baked with Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Hickory Smoked Bacon, had has a little spicy kick to it as well. <br><br>With that being said, let's talk about their Mac 'n Bacon Fries.<br><br>Mac n' Bacon Fries -- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F23Rjs1W&amp;s=604d05b978b34887ca93f7dbdc66e205f9f8c9b11e231d102f86467dbf9749b2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/23Rjs1W</a><br>Shoestring fries topped with Mac n' Bacon<br>Oh man!!  I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I ordered this.  Just look at the pic and see that this is the motherload of all things with fries, cheese, and bacon.  It's a humongous portion!!  Basically, if you're going to Off The Grid alone, this is your one-and-done dish for the night.  And oh yeah, this was delicious!!!  A great way to celebrate FryDays.<br><br>Because with my first visit being a carb overload, it had me going back again the very next week because I had to try their Jack Back Sammie which is an inside out grilled cheese sandwich.  So basically, they take the whole sandwich and press it on the grill while at the same time grilling a huge amount of cheese on the grill to create a cheese 'wrap' which is then used to wrap around the sandwich.  Whoa!  I decided to go big and have the American Jack Back which is stuffed with a beef and bacon burger patty inside.<br><br>American Jack Back Sammie -- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Vcuu0b&amp;s=978ee72e076c27ced3d5f97834b64c71e3c7b930ff3d00ec96b09ab79600cdb4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1Vcuu0b</a><br>Twice-grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with 50/50 Angus beef &amp; bacon patty<br>Yeah, I've had some really dangerously delicious burgers in my time, and this one ranks up there with the best of them.  The burger itself was juicy and had a good smoked flavor from the bits of bacon in the patty, almost like the burger from RickyBobby.  But the real star of this sandwich was the cheese 'wrap'.  Every bite was heavenly because the whole sandwich was covered in the melted grilled cheese.  This is a huge sandwich too and should be shared if you're at Off The Grid.  But if you're a hungry dude like me, go for it all!<br><br>Avocado Sliders (OTG Fort Mason Exclusive) -- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1QgRBOY&amp;s=8a9bdf666af6810b604a9a4bba2461e943ddc20c547dfda8116fc31a2422c4a9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1QgRBOY</a><br>Grilled avocado topped with Mac n' Bacon, with side of bacon topped Carolina slaw.<br>I thought this one was a bit of a disappointment.  It was pretty much just their Mac 'n Bacon with avocado and slaw. Not to say that that's a bad thing, because their Mac n' Bacon is awesome already, but I guess I tried it expecting something creative and different but ended up having something I've tried before but with avocado added.  Oh well, it was still good nonetheless.  Like I said earlier, you can never have too much bacon.<br><br>Aside from the Avocado Sliders, everything I've had from Bacon Mania is awesome and worth trying at least once if you're at Off The Grid Fort Mason.  Their food is pretty outrageous with the bacon and they don't hold back with the portion size.  If you only have to order one thing from this truck, I definitely recommend getting their Mac n' Bacon as a standalone since that's really their signature item, but if you're want to be a little more bold, the Mac n' Bacon Fries is the way to go.  <br><br>Mmm.....BACON!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw
Bacon MANia Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",4/16/2016,4,"Bacon Mania has been on my ""bucket list"" for a couple years.  I remember going to the very first Sactomofo and discovering that their truck broke down and they weren't coming, I was crushed.  But have no fear, just four short years later, I finally managed to get to their truck.  (I know, I'm not on the ball.)<br><br>We got to the Sactomofo West Elk Grove event around 5:40pm and there were not a lot of people there yet which was AMAZING.  I think I stood in line for less than 10 mins and then waited less than 5 mins for my sandwich/burger.  The guys were really nice.  I didn't feel rushed to ""get through the line"" but I felt that they were really efficient, a good balance.  <br><br>I ordered a Famous Jack Back Sammie and the guy taking my order recommended getting the one with the burger patty.  I figured since I was splitting it with my hubby, why not?  Oh my gosh, it was SO good!  I LOVED the crispy cheese on the outside!  The burger patty was SO delicious!  And I was really impressed that even with all the cheese and bacon, they managed to control the saltiness.  I've had a certain burger with tons of cheese grilled on to it from another place and it was VERY salty to me.  I had concerns about this sandwich from Bacon Mania but I didn't find it to be too salty at all.  <br><br>The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the price.  While the sandwich was large, $14 still felt like a lot for just a sandwich/burger and no drink or side.  However, that won't stop me from coming back.  I'm excited to try the Mac and Bacon next time.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=anPNIUo-9Qza-R1eJgiHJA

And im glad to finally see this place at OTG Concord after hearing rave reviews and seeing it appear on various food network tv shows and such. Let me get this review rolling by saying....Who has a Bacon Tooth?<br><br>Kinda like a sweet tooth, to some eating bacon is smililar. The crispy, greasy, hammy goodness makes most things just taste..better, and here at Bacon MANia they just continue to prove this fact. There is just something special about people dedicated to satisfying peoples ""bacon tooth"" and boy is mine big. Im just happy I didn't have to go all the way to Sacramento to see them. Their menu ranges from Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese to Specialty Sandwiches where of course Bacon is the ""STAR"" here....man I'm still excited as I type this review and eat. And the Bacon covered french fries in which I'm eating now....faint..okay revive. Let's talk about pricing and service a bit..<br><br>The prices are pretty fair. Ranging from about 5 bucks to about 15 bucks. Some may think that sound expensive but keep in mind, this is a food truck restaurant on wheels, take in gas, supplies, and the food they're preparing which I'm sure uses propane. I don't mind paying the prices. But the food has to be amazing.....and amazing it is here. The service was decent, the girl at the counter seen me taking my pics and asked if I was a Yelper....and then proceeded to ignore me when I walked up to order and took the customer behind me order....WTH..you just asked me if I'm a Yelper..did you think I wasn't hoing to mention this in the review? For Shame! But, I forgive her just this once...because the food totally makes up for it.<br><br>On this visit I had the ""ChiCheese Fries"" basically chilli cheese fries with of course Bacon made into the chilli, cheese, grilled onions and tomatoes and of course......""MORE BACON!"" nom nom nom nom nom. And some type of beef in here too. They were 11bucks plus two for the soda, so 13 bucks in total. Now I'm full and I still have a try of food, these meal weighs in at about 10 - 11oz btw....WOW! Insane yo!<br><br>In conclusion, you don't have to just see them on TV anymore, come and live the madness that is OTG and Bacon MANia, and try the food for yourself.

Gyro 2 Go,"Sacramento, CA",7/7/2015,5,"Of all the long standing food vendors at the farmer's markets, Gyro 2 Go is the best!! It's evident in the extremely long line to order, the longest of any food vendor at the markets. I love their halal gyro with rice, which comes with lettuce (a little side salad), white yogurt sauce, and sriracha. The meat is very tender and flavorful and goes really well with the basmati rice. It's very filling, but if you are craving something a little smaller, you can order the same dish in sandwich form. And by sandwich, I mean the same ingredients wrapped in a delicious warmed pita bread. It's really great for lunch! You can also choose tandoori chicken meat instead of gyro meat. I've been ordering lunch from this vendor for years and have not been disappointed. <br><br>I've seen Gyro 2 Go at the Wednesday farmer's market at Cesar Chavez Plaza, the Thursday Capitol Mall farmer's market, and Fridays at Concert in the Park. When it's lunchtime, the lines are usually the longest at Gyro 2 Go, which says something good about their food. The only slightly negative part is having to wait in a long line to order on a hot summer day. Although once you order, the food is ready pretty quickly.  <br><br>This year, the price of the gyro or chicken with rice is $7.75 and comes with a soda or water. The price of the sandwich is $7. The price keeps going up each year, but I still want my gyro from Gyro 2 Go as it is the best! <br><br>And on a side note, the workers there are not shabby on the eyes.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Hj9gGdI2Iz5gmsorFVYyow

Not too heavy, not too bland. Thinking about it right now is making me hungry. The guy who served us wasn't too social or friendly, but I'll let that go because he looked like he had an extremely long day. I can sympathize.

You can get gyro, chicken, or falafel in either of these forms; all items come with a free canned soda or bottled water.  The sandwich is basically a pita with onion, lettuce, tomato, and yogurt sauce.  ""Over rice"" is the same vegetables served more like a salad on one side with the protein on the other, all on a bed of seasoned basmati.  If you get it ""spicy"" they drizzle sriracha on the whole thing.  By the time I get back to the office, it's a withered horrible mess--a delicious, withered, horrible mess that I have been scarfing down nearly every Wednesday for the past three months.<br><br>I'm sure there are other places the Gyro guys will set up shop and efficiently dole out their delectable sodium-laden goodies, but none so close to the office.  Thus the season changes to make way for equally fattening fare.  See you in May, Gyro 2 Go!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=q_Ut8HBElVOGcHBJpJOr_A

Gyro 2 Go,"Sacramento, CA",5/1/2011,5,"I pass this place every day as I live nearby. I finally stopped in for lunch and got a huge gyro sandwich with halal gyro meat (lamb and beef with spices), tomatoes, lettuce, white sauce and sriracha. The sandwich and a can of cold pop cost me exactly $5 and it was completely worth it. The guy working heated the pita and the meat up on a griddle and then assembled the whole works and wrapped it up like a Chipotle burrito (and it was almost as big). He also had various chicken and falafal options and you could get it all over seasoned rice instead of in a pita. The gyro I got was really tasty. Hot, spicy meat, crunchy veg and cool white sauce, all wrapped up in a toasted pita: pretty hard to beat. <br><br>I find it mildly ironic that there's never a line at this place which serves delicious and relatively healthy fare every day in a cool setting (McKinley Park, to the right of the library) yet people waited in line for hours to eat at the food trucks at SactoMofo.

There is something different about these compared to a Greek gyro that you would get anywhere else. It's kind of a tandoori spice with the cucumber flavor in the white sauce and the soft pita.

By the time i arrived, there were no lines, and i had to ask a few ppl lingering around about getting inside and my VIP ""tix"". The organizers were about to leave and he just told me to go find a spot in the front section. Well, EVERYONE had blankets and laid down camping chairs and gear. Lots of ppl who weren't VIP tix holders were in front, so how does this make it fair? i thought there were closed off sections. Just zero customer service (no calls back), seems to not have mattered on how much you paid as it's ""sit as you like"" type of deal. I won't be attending any of their events.

I didn't really want to eat the lunch I brought today, so I figured I'd give it a whirl. The line was long and the prices were slightly less gouging than your normal food truck, so that's a plus I guess. <br><br>Sisig is my favorite item on another Phillipino food truck that comes here, so despite the fact that it said it contained pig snout and chicken liver, I braved the Sisig anyway, enticed by the jalapeños and lemon. NOPE. Not a fan. It's very rare that I won't eat something after having paid for it, but not today. Yuck. The texture was difficult to overcome but the lack of flavor made it not even worth trying. The garlic fried rice was bland at best. The lumpia, how dare they even call it that! No. This is an imposter. My mom, as white as she is, learned to make lumpia back in the day from a tiny little phillipino lady that her boyfriends brother was married to and it is glorious.

It looked like seared tuna, it was that undercooked. My fiancé ordered the pork and hers was also not cooked. Not as bad as mine but still not cooked. I gave it back to the guy at the window and waited. To my surprise they gave us back the same exact pieces that we had both already taken bites from.... i didn't think you could send something back to a customer after they had eaten some of it.

Would order that again- good flavor.<br>Smoothies were 7 for small/ 9 for a large and the shaved ice were 5$.<br>They were making a mint this weekend because the weather is pushing 100 everyday.

I grabbed a saplings worth of napkins as I anticipated the upcoming shaved ice disaster and grabbed a seat near the truck. As people passed by I noticed them glance at the chilly treat then double back for the truck. I really should have been paid for my advertising for them but I guess I was with the raspberry colossus that was starting to numb my hand. I tried to delicately eat away at the cone but there were casualties with the ground beneath my feet turning into a blue puddle of sugar water. Embarrassed, I walked away and found another spot only to create another lake. I was only able to eat a third (and I'm being liberal with my consumption here) but my husband was able to eat quite a bit. Unfortunately, the ice melted and I was left with a fifth of a container of blue colored sugar water.

It’s Nacho Truck,"Rancho Cordova, CA",7/5/2018,3,"I tried the chicken nachos/fries (got both chips and fries) when they were at the Fourth on The Field event. Sadly, I was disappointed, and it wasn't really worth the hour long line. They committed the cardinal sin of nachos of having barely any cheese, which I was afraid of after seeing the previous customers keep walking by one after the other with dishes where I couldn't see any cheese on them. I had to dig around to the bottom of the dish to try and scrape some up. It was also way too salty, and didn't have much flavor at all except just plain salt.

I was super anxious leading up to it, because communication was scarce, and I heard food trucks at weddings sometimes takes a long time. We had about 75 people at our wedding, and it was definitely a good number to go with a food truck. It didn't take nearly as long as I was thinking, and I couldn't be happier.

During my last visit, they were located in downtown on 5th &amp; R. Made sure I came early since I heard they have ran out of fish tacos in the past before! For $10, you get two tacos along with a side of sweet potato chips. Their tacos are mouthwatering, super juicy and full of flavor!!! They are topped with lettuce, tomatoes and their famous house sauce that makes these tacos worth every bite. I didn't care much for the sweet potato chips. They tasted mediocre and I ended up tossing them out. My co-worker had actually asked to replace the chips with a side salad, which looked amazing and tasty! Wish they can make chips OR salad an option on their menu, but I'm definitely going to have to ask for salad in lieu of chips next time! :) <br><br>If you do have the chance to visit this truck - you gotta make sure you try their tacos!!

One of the best sandwiches I've had lately!!!! (Am I using enough exclamation marks to show you how excited I am about this sandwich?) <br><br>The sandwich consisted of tri-tip topped w/ slaw on what I believe is a ciabatta bun. It seems simple but everything was so tasty. The tri tip consisted of thick, tender and juicy pieces of meat with BBQ sauce. There was a good amount of meat in every bite. The slaw was creamy while the bun held the sandwich nicely together. I should have paced myself, because the sandwich was gone before I knew it.<br><br>It came with a side of sweet potato chips. The chips were thinly sliced and tasted much healthier than fries. Less carbs! <br><br>I think this is my favorite food truck!

I have heard that dinner is also wonderful but haven't had a chance to try yet. For Sunday brunch they have live music. The group when we were there was good - R&amp;B, jazzy.

Also, they don't have a hard liquor license so don't order mixed drinks unless you like them made with wine.

Hefty Gyros,"Sacramento, CA",10/27/2016,4,"Every time I see this food truck, I head on over and order one of my two favorites.  Either a gyro rice plate or falafel rice plate $10 each.  <br><br>The plates tastes way better than it looks.  It's not awful looking, but not particularly eye catching.  The yogurt sauce they drizzle over the food is yummy.  The gyro meat is tasty and mild not overwhelming lamb of beef, a good combo.  The falafels are fried whole and served in cut pieces.  They are fried perfectly with no greasy mess, great great texture, and spices done right.  The rice is a fragrant type of wild brown rice that I find to be moist, fluffy, and flavorful.  The green salad consist of shredded iceberg lettuce, purple onions, cucumbers, and tomatoes.  <br><br>I had no issues with the red sauce they drizzled over the food.  But I noticed in other reviews that some say it's a bit hot spicy, but it wasn't for me.  So you may want to ask about the sauces if you don't like spicy.  The fellas working the truck are kind and respectful.  The fella taking the orders is a sweetheart, don't be hesitant to ask him questions about the food and menu. <br><br>They take all types of credit card and Apple Pay.  But there is a .55 charge for orders under $15.  <br> <br>Also the food is halal, great for those that observe.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QiLRN_sdJSGkWtJnPCwE3w
Hefty Gyros,"Elk Grove, CA",5/17/2017,5,"Stop reading reviews and just try them. Our favorite is the Chicken over Rice plate. Comes with a large enough portion to share with one other. Chicken is always good, juicy, flavorful, and cooked right. Their yogurt sauce is very good and compliments the flavors of the chicken and rice. The chicken over rice comes with a good amount of fresh salad mix too. The chicken gyros are very good and taste better than some expensive sit-down restaurants I've been to. Check them out on Facebook or Sacto MoFo for updates on where they will be next and go get yourself some Hefty Gyros!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1noEnpLlagabkc7TXKXBBQ
La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Rancho Cordova, CA",9/7/2016,3,"This was the 2nd time I've had tacos from this truck. The first time, the meat was pretty dry. This last time, the meat was better and it came with a chipotle sauce which was good. I wish they had a less spicy salsa that I could add to the tacos to make them taste a little better. They have the section with a bunch of different salsas and some lime which is good but maybe if they added some salt and pepper shakers or salt packets to add to the tacos, that would also help.

La Mex Taqueria Truck,"Sacramento, CA",10/28/2016,4,"First time having lunch at this food truck. They had a really long line which is a good sign. I ordered the veggie burrito with no cheese or sour cream. It's a nice sized burrito with rice, whole pinto beans, fresh sliced avocado and pico de gallo and at $8.00 not a bad deal. There is a 0.25 charge to use your debit/credit card.<br><br>They had three different types of salsas:<br>     1. A green salsa which I am assuming is tomatillo. This was the spiciest of the bunch.<br>     2. An orangey-red salsa that wasn't quite as hot as the green but still respectably spicy.<br>     3. A thicker dark red salsa with a kick and a nice smoky flavor. This one was my favorite.<br><br>Salsa and chips were only $2.00 if you wanted to start small. Even though the line was long it moved quickly. They have tacos, burritos, tostadas and quesedillas. And you can choose your meat - beef, chicken, pork, fish or veggie.

From first glance the tacos looked good, I liked the grilled onions and cilantro.<br><br>3. Flavor and Taste: The carnitas were especially bland, no meaningful flavor at all. Just cooked meat with onions and cilantro. The asada wasn't much better. As a person that frequents taquerias, I know a good taco when I eat one...and the best part should be the meat, but in this case it wasn't at all.

Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Live Oak, CA",10/18/2018,5,"Out of all the Asian food trucks available in the Sac area, Kados is by far my favorite. Every Tuesday, I stop by the truck  at UC Davis to try something new on their menu. At this point I've had it all. <br><br>My favorite dish is the street tacos! There aren't any tacos around quite like them. Something about their slaw topped with their aioli makes these bad boys amazing. Definitely have to order them spicy.<br><br>If you are looking for something filling, I recommend going for it all and ordering a three meat sampler plate. You get to try the three meats they offer over a bed of rice, and a side of sprouts and salad. <br><br>Lastly, out of all the trucks I go to at UC Davis, this truck overlaps the others in customer service. The very few times I've had an issue, or if there was any confusion, the owners and their staff made sure to accommodate me.

Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Davis, CA",10/17/2018,2,Caught it on the UC Davis campus last night outside Silo.<br><br>The tacos say served "street style".  Street style is two regular sized corn tortillas per taco (because corn tortillas break).   These are served on single mini tortillas.   Not street style but the price is okay at $8 for 3.  Can't give more than 2 stars when they are described as "street style" and are not for two extremely obvious reasons.  <br><br>The real winner here was the teriyaki chicken bowl.  Decent rice for a food truck and a nice succulent char.  I could eat a pound of this chicken by itself.   At $10 per bowl that would come to about $30.<br><br>Service here was grumpy.   The lady that took my order seemed pissed off when I asked what the chicken was seasoned with.   Order was ready at the pick up window in less than 3 minutes and that dude was cheerful.

Kado’s Asian Grill Food Truck,"Citrus Heights, CA",5/23/2018,4,"I have to be honest that I haven't really ate from a whole lot of food trucks. Aside from the typical ""taco"" trucks, I am still an amateur at venturing into unique and one-of-a-kind offerings from other types of foods on four wheels. Well, this particular truck called ""Kado's Asian Grill Food Truck"" was definitely above average from my standards.<br><br>After attending UC Davis' annual ""Picnic Day"" event which is always held during the 3rd April of every year, I was in need of something that would be way better than your typical hot dogs and cheeseburgers. After reading several Yelp reviews about this place, I figured I would give it a try. <br><br>The line wasn't too long but the weather was very cooperative with sunny skies and about 80°. After patiently waiting for nearly 30 minutes, I was finally ready to place my order. I decided to go with 1/2 &amp; 1/2 combination plate a.k.a. ""Kado's Special Chicken &amp; Teriyaki Chicken"". This consisted of steamed white rice, marinated bean sprouts, and Asian salad. Price (as of April 2018) was a decent $12.<br><br>After opening up the cardboard container it was packaged in, this place gives you a TON of food! And you definitely get your moneys' worth. My teriyaki chicken was tender, moist, and had the perfect zest of sauce that made this very tasty. The Kado's chicken was over the top amazing though; they use a marinaded blend of honey, Kaffir lime leaves, and Sriracha which gave the overall flavor a truly unique one. I highly recommend anyone that visits a Kado's food truck to give this one a try. The sprouts and salad were just average, nothing too thrilling about that.<br><br>Overall, ""Kado's Asian Grill"" is a truck that was surprisingly delicious. The exterior pistachio colored green is definitely not hard to miss. I would definitely follow them on Facebook as they give frequent updates of where their truck will be located. For the most part, they make trips around the Davis and Sacramento areas. With that said and done, this is a truck I will eat at again.

They had me at rice bowls and I didn't bother giving other food trucks my business after trying a sample of their chicken . As soon as you walk up to their truck , you will be greeted by the owners daughter and then you will be asked if you'd like any samples .

Unfortunately the flavors of kafir and lime weren't visible but I still thought the chicken was good . For my side , I got the fried rice instead of white rice. The fried rice was really good ! I'd say that it was the highlight of my meal . My best friend ordered the ribs with fried rice and regretted it. Although the ribs were covered in sauce, I took a few bites and noticed that the meat itself was tough and dry which was disappointing . <br><br>Overall, I'd  say the food was just ok .

I was skeptical--as I am with all food trucks--of the food's quality. You have to ask: Will it be just another grease fest? Plus, this is probably TMI but I have borderline paranoia about contracting some food-borne illness by eating meals prepared in trucks--it just seems like a hot-bed for unsanitary preparation. Fears be damned, I sought them out anyway. <br><br>And, I'm so glad I took a gamble on this place because Bambi allayed my fears on both accounts--the food was stellar with terrific presentation and flavor profile AND the truck was impeccably clean. Not only that but the staff servicing the truck and making the food were super chill and open to talking about their plans to expand. Based on my first experience with this food truck, I have to say, their presence is a welcome addition to the taco game in Sac and they are some serious contenders for the ""best of"" category!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0b-x4uyN9la5T8ym0djyvw
Bambi,"Sacramento, CA",11/2/2018,4,"Really good! The Bambi smacks of Jimboy's. I bit into it and immediately got it! It's genius! I would totally eat that taco on heavy rotation. The parm didn't taste vegan at all :)<br><br>Would love more menu options and salsas. The Bambi would've been amazing with guac &amp; lime &amp; cilantro and........ you know :)<br><br>I tried the chorizo taco but I hate chorizo, lol. But it was a well made piece of food.<br><br>Will definitely try them again next time I see them out!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pC1jwUrTuD2H5XJyE-JFoQ
Bambi,"Sacramento, CA",9/23/2018,4,"Vegans rejoice, Bambi Food Truck is here and serving up tasty tacos.<br><br>The simple fact that this food truck exists is a major win for vegetarians and vegans. No longer will you roam through the crowd of meat based food trucks, asking For vegan options, now there is a dedicated truck with a vegan menu to appease your appetite.<br><br>Bambi offers a small menu of vegan tacos and sometimes a special, for example a grain bowl or potato dish. The flavors are bold and creative, and the times I have visited the truck I heard people saying, ""yummy!"" &amp; ""omg this is sooooo good"". Carnivores love this menu as well...fried and crispy goodies seasoned well, with creative out-of-the-box flavors attract many palates. Kudos to you Bambi!<br><br>A few of the taco offerings include: Cornmeal crusted Eggplant with fresh slaw, homemade ""chorizo"" and potato, spicy cauliflower, pickled veggies, jackfruit ""meat"", and more. A fried crispy shell and some with guacamole make each one instagram-worthy! The kitchen and truck are immaculate and crowds start to gather around when they arrive.<br><br>I do have 1 issue with the menu: Almost everything is deep fried, grilled in oil or Made with heavy starch and carbs. I get it, fat makes everything taste better, but a few healthier options (besides the pickled onions and fresh garnishes) that are not fried/grilled would be great. Even the slaw has a ton of oil (albeit probably a delicious organic olive oil). <br><br>The beauty of offering vegan food is the opportunity to be creative. Cornmeal crusted eggplant? Yes please! There is no dispute, this was insanely good, but not everyone who is vegan wants a fat carb bomb sitting in their stomach.<br><br>So, I ask the wonderful clever team behind this truck to please consider a few different, possibly healthier options?<br><br>If not, I will still continue to praise this restaurant on wheels, and on occasion, as a special treat, order up a delicious, maddeningly good fried taco.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3C8qIpUX48siYEdzTs1mrQ

Bambi,"Sacramento, CA",,5,The food at this truck was absolutely delicious! I'm a Vegetarian and I ordered everything on the menu and it was all fantastic. The chorizo was a bit spicy but super flavorful.

Bambi,"Elk Grove, CA",8/15/2018,4,"Good food, VERY limited menu, very pricey for what it is ($6 for one small taco???), but I'm just so happy to be seeing a vegan option in the area that isn't Asian food. (Don't get me wrong- I love Asian food, but typically that's about 90% of the vegan food I find.) Their nachos we're almost too spicy for my husband and I to eat, so I'll have to ask them next time if there's a way to tone that down. The Bambi taco ($4) was delicious and I would have eaten two more of those if they weren't so dang expensive. The $6 eggplant taco, which I expected to be my favorite, had only three small pieces of eggplant and not much else going on. I will definitely be seeking them out, but expecting to spend more than twice as much as I normally do at a food truck.

Paquitas Mexican Grill,"Sacramento, CA",10/11/2018,5,"This is actually an updated review of Paquitas. The first few visits I had a less than 5 star experience and did detail it in my original yelp. After the family that runs this truck went through a horrific experience that resulted in all of them being significantly injured they re-opened after a few months. <br><br>I always want to support local business and so I decided to give them another chance. Unfortunatelu I arrived right as they were closing but the owner approached me, and assured me they would be open the next day and invited me back. He asked my name and realized that I was the person that had written the original post. BUT he wasn't rude or intimidating at all. He assured me that he read my review, and wanted me to have a much better experience and again invited me back the next day. <br><br>I didn't make it back until the next week but he remembered me and rolled out the red carpet. I don't get the feeling that this was solely about the yelp review, but rather this was a family owned business that literally has poured their blood sweat and tears into their business. They are working hard to establish themselves as a fixture in the neighborhood and genuinely worked to rebuild and reframe my experience. <br><br>I give 3 stars alone for the customer service. They owned what happened previously and worked to make it right. The entire family was a pleasure to speak to and they clearly want to build a business that meets the needs of all their customers. <br><br>The final two stars are the food. Yummy options and the chicken quesadilla is my (and my daughter's) favorite! Last time my husband got the carne asada fries and OMG they were huge, cheesy, and delicious. We've had the tacos and really enjoyed those as well. <br><br>I look forward to future visits and trying more of Their yummy options. Keep an eye out on next door for deals.

I was a little disappointed that there were only bits of pieces of pork belly. It would have been better if there were more bits of pieces of pork belly. The way how they stacked the food in this burrito I think looks like this: tortilla, egg, and ramen mixed with the bits of pieces of pork belly. I didn't eat it like a burrito because I wanted to dissect the burrito to see what was inside and that's how I found out about the bits of pieces of pork belly.

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Sacramento, CA",9/25/2016,3,"The food truck was at a event at The Barn in West Sacramento. As the line inched forward, several items began to sell out (including the crab mac &amp; cheese grilled cheese). There were also several customers that already paid, but was later told they had to order something else. I went with the crunchy beef sope- marinated crispy sirloin, spicy kimchi, sweet chili sauce. rice puffs, shallot, and warm sope. I was a bit disappointed with this. It would've been better if the sirloin was tender and the dish was sweeter than I would've liked. It was also difficult to eat the masa. Even though I didn't enjoy this too much, I know their menu changes regularly. I am interested in trying their other items.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ep8NBpLx5cfwy2CaE7cG4A

The gyro truck line was crazy, so I decided to check out Flavor Face. I couldn't decide between the shrimp tempura po boy or the crab mac n cheese grilled cheese. I decided on the crab mac n cheese grilled cheese. Not a bad price for a crab sandwich. We only get 30 mins for lunch and it look 27 mins to get my food people that ordered food way after me got their food and were halfway back to the office. Was the sandwich worth the wait? No, only if I was in a restaurant. Was the sandwich good? Hella ya it was good! The homemade chips were good as well.

The crab is not overwhelming and although it's very cheesy the sandwich isn't too greasy. <br><br>My friend thinks bits of jalapeño would complete the sandwich, while I disagree. Bacon bits though? That's another story.

Mama Kim Cooks,"Roseville, CA",11/18/2013,4,"I feel so conflicted about this review. <br><br>SMH. <br><br>Been here twice now. The first time was 5-star all-around. We had a large brunch party (13ish ladies + one *ahem*adorable*ahem* infant that may or may not be related to me) and they accomodated our party without a hitch. Food was on point. Service, too. (Server wasn't bad to look at either. I'm just saying.)<br><br>Second time, not so much. My dish (baked french toast) wasn't cooked completely. I was only able to eat a few bites of it. Service not so hot either. Infant still cute as hell tho. <br><br>Saving grace? The band. Oh my, the band. For a music whore like myself this could save probably ANY meal (except for that Yard House steak that one time...*shivers*....). Just three guys: a guitarist, an amazing pianist who plays blind better than I EVER could with full sight, and Phillip, the restaurant co-owner slash trio's lead vocalist.<br><br>There's something about enjoying a mimosa to a jazzy live rendition of Dock Of The Bay that just sets your soul (and tummy) to feeling right. <br><br>Go.

Mama Kim Cooks,"Folsom, CA",12/9/2014,1,"As you read this review please keep in mind this is about their catering business, as I see many of these reviews are not, even though that's the Mama Kim Cooks business. Mama Kim Cooks catered my wedding this past October. I don't even know where to start with how upsetting the entire experience was. Please note that this is my ONLY 'bad review' I have ever given on Yelp. I do not believe in bad mouthing businesses. Please also note that this review comes after hearing NOTHING back from the staff here after my mom and I wrote a letter giving them ample time to make right what they did, but a month has passed and we have heard nothing and I feel this is the only way for me to feel I have some power left in this situation. <br>First I'll state what everyone else has, the food is excellent. And that was a reason we ignored some of the 'red flags' in the beginning because we really loved their food. Some of the red flags was poor communication as their coordinator Annie would take WEEKS to answer our emails or my questions, whereas all my other vendors would respond within days. That's fine, in the beginning, but as your wedding gets closer, trust me you will want questions answered more quickly. For example THE DAY OF MY WEDDING Annie emailed me 'explaining' why they would be increasing the total bill( 500$) as my wedding venue told them they could absolutely NOT arrive the time of the wedding to start. Excuse me but why would a catering company think it was ever okay to arrive when the guests did? All my friends in the restaurant business told me that is unheard of. So I talk to my parents (yep the DAY OF MY WEDDING I'm discussing this because they are the most unorganized company I have ever seen) We decide to just let it go and not waste our precious time on worrying about something we feel we can't control. Okay fine, <br><br>Now it's dinner time. We had a buffet and paid for 150 people to eat dinner, which included my DJ, two photographers, and all guests of course. We paid for 150 people to have chicken, pork, veggies, cornbread (which we paid extra PER person for), cheese tortellini, and salad, which all tasted great. But 18 of our guests only had a dinner consisting of ONE slice of pork, corn bread and tortellini because they ran out of food. EIGHTEEN OF MY GUESTS. Not one or two people. The BEST part is when my mother went to pay her and asked if they could compensate us  for the EIGHTEEN people (THREE FULL TABLES) that did not get the full meals we paid for, she was so rude, it still infuriates me weeks later. Blaming my guests for going back for seconds or taking too big of portions, AS IF MY GUESTS SHOULD KNOW HOW MUCH FOOD THERE IS? Is this lady insane? and by lady I am speaking of Mama Kim herself who was the one who was incredibly rude to my parents. I have read other reviews on here about her demeanor and this lady is horrible. She is lucky her food is so good because she would never survive in business with her poor customer service skills. <br>So not only did we pay an additional 500$ (as we were informed that day), 18 of our guests didn't get the meal we paid for them to have. <br>Now let's talk about bartenders. I enjoy bars often actually, and a great bartender is the best. These two people, YELLED at my MOH for asking for champagne for her and I before the wedding, mind you all the alcohol was bought privately by my husband and I and Mama Kim's did not supply a drop. After the wedding several of my friends told me the bartenders were incredibly rude and looked miserable to be there. I hate that my guests, who are people my husband and I hold so close to our hearts, were treated like this. Maybe these bartenders knew and hated us in a past life, because they freely gave away all our alcohol when the wedding was over. As one of my best friends recalled their words specifically were, 'Once we are done, it's free to take'. Who the HELL do you people think you are? My husband and I didn't get any of the left over wedding wine or champagne. Thankfully many of our guests who did take some in the moment, brought it to us the next day, but how embarrassing. I feel like I paid 6,500$ for a bunch of street thugs who possess no manners or common sense, to cater our wedding. I hope no bride goes through what we went through with these people! Lot's of places have great food. It's not worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=P7ww78BthQ_SMrG0QE5O8Q

Mama Kim Cooks,"Dixon, CA",10/22/2013,5,"This is a review of their catering service. We used them for our June 15th wedding. I must say I am a bit of an organized, control freak and I LOVE food. So choosing the food was the most important thing to me, after my dress! I could not be any happier with my choice to go with Mama Kim's. They were recommended to me by a friend who used them at her wedding a couple years prior, as well as a client of mine who uses them for any family event. <br><br>The food was delicious!!! 10 out of 10. Everyone complimented us on the food, and there was nothing left. <br><br>But Steve, the coordinator was AMAZING!! He is what sealed the deal for us!<br>He was my favorite vendor to work with. He was very easy to communicate with, he always answered my emails or phone calls quickly and was always there to help.<br>We met with him at their restaurant where we were treated to a dinner to try their cuisine and we loved almost everything. We decided right then and there to book them for our wedding. We just clicked with Steve, and we felt he completely understand what we were going for.<br><br>Steve went over menu options with us that fit the style of our wedding, our taste and our budget. He also coordinated all of our rentals for us as our venue provided nothing - we needed tables, linens, place setting, silverware, chairs, umbrellas, etc... Steve ordered everything; his staff set it all up and broke it down the day of our wedding. <br>You can easily tell he was very experienced and gave us great advice on our wedding in general. He also took the time to come to our venue with me, as he had never worked an event there, to see the layout and setup. He was also great about communicating with our venue and other vendors to ensure everyone was on the same page and everything would flow smoothly. <br>We provided our own alcohol and hired their bartender, he was a tremendous help in letting us know how much we should purchase and what would pair best with the food they were preparing. He was even there himself on the day of our wedding, working the carving station. It was so nice to see him there! I knew that everything would be taken care of, as if I were doing it myself. <br><br>I would HIGHLY recommend Mama Kim Cooks and Steve to anyone and everyone looking for catering. Everything from the planning, the service and the food were top notch!<br><br>On a side note: we loved the vibe and food at the restaurant as well when we went for our tasting. We can't wait to go back for brunch or dinner and relive the delicious food of our wedding, and hopefully see Steve!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rVAPGcgfz9VlBhMxJMspkw

Azteca Street Tacos,"Reno, NV",8/18/2017,3,"I ate at Azteca at the Farm to Fork Festival, and I was really disappointed. I wanted some delicious food truck lunch, and I got bland, lame, mushy nachos made with obviously canned cheese sauce and no real cheese whatsoever. What are good nachos without gooey cheese on top?? I saw a picture posted previously and it looked like that costumer had got nachos that came with REAL cheese and some type of yummy looking sauce on top, but mine didn't have any of this. <br><br>I'm giving three stars because the portion was huge for the price ($8) and it seems like they didn't up their prices like the other food trucks at the festival did. This was the only place that I could get a pretty affordable meal- but maybe that's because they compromised their quality. That might have been a mistake, because I know that at least for me, next time I have a choice between food trucks and Azteca is one of them, I will most definitely choose another truck, regardless of price.

Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",5/12/2015,5,"This review is for Mama Kims Cooks (their catering service).  I just got married about 2 weeks ago, and used their services for my brunch wedding. Overall I was extremely satisfied with their services.  The one thing that I think some other reviewers mentioned is that their communication via email can be quite slow, but I found that I was always able to call Annie via phone and reach her with no problems.  <br><br>Annie was my go-to person and she is genuinely very sweet.  I felt very comfortable talking with her and we went through the estimated bill together and were able to rent items through their restaurant, rather than a party rental company and save some money. Their pricing was quite reasonable and they also built me a custom menu to fit my needs, as my husband's family is mostly vegetarian/vegan.  I had two appetizers, and about 5 dishes for a brunch wedding, as well as beverages including coffee, tea, lemonade for about ~$24/person.  The day of the wedding went very smoothly, they came and set up around the back of the venue and brunch was ready to start right on time.  I don't recall any issues the entire day, except that there were not labels for each food item.  For me this was not a big deal, but we did have one dish that had meat in it, so that is important to keep in mind for vegetarians/vegans. <br><br>I would use them again in a hearbeat for my next catering event.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_b-DmDgjCOSG8T1xby02ZA

Crave Food Truck,"Sacramento, CA",,4,I tried the Ninja taco this pas weekend at the Trucktoberfest.  I have to say this taco was amazing!!! I highly disagree with the other review.  The Korean beef was so flavorful and they give you a good amount of it. The meat is from Korean short ribs that has been cut up into bite sized portions.  The tortilla shell was nice and thin and the asian slaw on top added the perfect amount of crunch and spice to the incredible tasting meat. The taco was only $4 and larger then a typical taco.  I highly recommend Crave Food Truck.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KGqI3yiTPNMf1C7moDz2RA

Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",9/4/2011,4,"Experienced Mama Kim's Food truck when they catered an event I attended and it was very nice.  When I heard Mama Kim's I was expecting Asian Food but was pleasantly surprised with equally tasty selections of the non-Asian variety. The purple truck served up four lunch entrees for the group with tasty accompaniments. The choices included chicken salad, Turkey and Brie on a biscuit, a Tri-tip  Sando and one other. The tri-tip and Turkey and Brie seemed to be the most popular although I heard no complaints as people tried all the delicious choices. The Turkey and Brie with mixed greens on a biscuit was a upscale twist on the turkey and cheese sandwich. It was served with a pear and walnut salad with a unique addictive dressing.The biscuit reminded me of a served cold, heartier R*d Lobst*r biscuit when you laid eyes on it.  I dunked the biscuit sandwich in the dressing to give it more moisture. D-lish! (See Amy J's photo as that image is spot on.) The tri-tip got accolades with it's slaw and sweet potato fried chips by many as well. The hungry lunch crowd was fed and happy in a timely fashion. I would definitely try them again if they were at a location I was at.  Give them a go!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=q00wVQ32ZULDJYsdAw1tgA
Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",4/9/2013,5,"This is a review of their catering service.  We used Mama Kim Cooks as the caterer for our wedding.  They were great!  Reasons:<br><br>1. The food was delicious.  We tried their food at the restaurant beforehand and enjoyed it, and we weren't disappointed with the cuisine for our wedding reception.  Many guests remarked on how yummy the food was.<br>2. The coordinator, Steve Lach, was great.  We met with him about what we wanted, and he worked within our budget to produce a menu to our liking.  He's also very experienced with weddings, and he provided us with good general advice on receptions and schedules.<br>3. He was great about communicating with the DJ, wedding day coordinator, and other vendors to make sure everyone was on the same page and that things were running smoothly.<br>4. We had a last minute hiccup where we realized that we needed more ice for the bar -- this was on the morning of our wedding!  I called Steve Lach, and he got it for us, no problem.<br>5. I didn't know that Steve was going to actually be working at our reception, but when I (groom) was getting food from the buffet and reached the end, and I saw him manning the tri-tip station -- it was so reassuring to see his friendly face.  It was like seeing an old friend!<br><br>When planning a wedding, we learned that you want to use vendors that are trustworthy and experienced -- it makes the planning process, and the actual wedding day, much easier.  Mama Kim Cooks, and Steve Lach, were great!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Twe0QQ3OweATKBnkN9EwhQ

Mama Kim Cooks,"Sacramento, CA",3/30/2012,2,"The truck parks on 9th and O Street on Tuesday's.The first time I tried their Thai Noodle Salad and it was awesome. On the same visit the board stated they had chocolate chip cookies. I ordered one and when I got back to my office, I took it out of the bag. It was Oatmeal Raisin! I hate raisins but I didn't want to go back to the truck. The following week I went back but the truck was a no-show! Then I went the following week and the guy said they were not there the previous week because they were exhausted from working the Labor Day weekend. Well they didn't have the noodle salad so I ordered the tomato soup. They forgot to heat it up so I had to wait.  It was ok. Then I went on 9/20/11 and no show again!! So this past Tuesday they showed up. I ordered a portabella mushroom on ciabatta... Without cheese. While the guy is fixing it he tells me they ran out of avocado (or did they forget?) ; no offer of price reduction. I did get BBQ chips. In the beginning the sandwiches came with sweet potato fries. They don't have that anymore! So I get back to the office a little miffed as the sandwich w/o cheese and avocado cost $8! Then I tried the sandwich and the bread was stale! I ate the mushroom, roasted pepper and chips and threw the bread away. No more Mama Kim for me! They have raised their prices by a dollar since the end of August.  They are not dependable as you don't know if they will show up or not. Their website doesn't show any information.

If you are looking for some incredible Greek food this is your spot. If you are looking to spice up your catering order THIS IS IT. The prices are great beyond worth the incredible flavors you will be enjoying. If you're in the area please give these guys a shot you won't be disappointed.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jmxExnRh6dJf7FX3uXg_WA

Hefty Gyros,"Elk Grove, CA",9/8/2016,4,"Tried out Hefty Gyros as the truck stopped near work as part of SactoMoFo's lunch events. I opted for the $9 gyro salad and it turned out pretty decent! Great flavored meat and the portion was filling. Quick turnaround after you order as well.<br><br>They DO take credit card! There's a sign on the truck that says there's a 50 cent charge for card if your purchase is under $15, but it didn't seem to apply. No receipt was given so I can only assume it's the $9 total they told me... Eep!<br><br>Mini update: I was charged $9.50!

They are at Gold Center In Rancho Cordova in support of the Green Fair today. I told friends and coworkers to buy food from them today after I started eating my food. Some tried it and liked it!!

Hefty Gyros,"Sacramento, CA",10/23/2017,5,I was at Pumpkin Nights in Auburn last night and I cannot stop thinking about this truck's food! Their food is amaaaaazing! And this is coming from someone who's pretty picky about their Halal food. Their white sauce is to DIE for! <br>I was originally walking toward the truck with chicken wings but the guy at the front stopped me and gave me a sample of their chicken and white sauce. I was convinced the minute I tried it and I ended up ordering the Hefty Gyro Fries. Delicious! Can't wait to see their truck around again!,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jeXsWgX8MhlTpJLFEet8uQ
Hefty Gyros,"San Jose, CA",4/15/2018,5,"I'm located in the South Bay so I had never heard of this food truck before. But LET ME TELL YOU... their food is so good! I'm honestly really sad they aren't located closer to San Jose. We had attended the Sacramento Light Fest this past weekend where there were only 4 food trucks to choose from so you could imagine how long I waited in line. I thought, honestly I would have been just sitting waiting to launch the lantern so I might as well just wait for food. I probably waited an hour maybe a little more but it was totally worth it! I was bummed that they ran out of the rice plates but we ordered the hefty fries, a gyro pita and a chicken pita. All so delicious! I especially loved the hefty fries! It was the first time I had ever seen anything like it so I was excited to try it and was not disappointed!

Hefty Gyros,"Bakersfield, CA",3/23/2016,5,"OK....this place is legit. If you haven't read my other reviews of Mediterranean style cuisine, I'm always on the quest for the best gyros I can find. It's one of my favorite foods and I'm Greek, so I've tried a bunch. Anyways, I saw this place at food truck mania in West Sac tonight and thought I would give it a whirl. Thank god I did!!!!<br><br>First of all, the guy on register was super sweet! Great customer service. Second, the gyro and fries were on point. I had the traditional gyro and it was so flavorful. Great use of spices and sauce. Omnomnom. Then I had fries that seemed like they had some sort of tzatziki and sriracha on them? I'm not sure if that was exactly it but they were also delicious and spicy in a hot kinda way. Loved it. It is probably the second best gyro I've ever had. That is an achievement!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Izigq3SiKVrU3p6bG7xgPg

Hefty Gyros,"Elk Grove, CA",3/2/2016,5,"2 words: HEFTY FRIES<br><br>If you're ever at the Hefty Gyros truck, get the hefty fries and get ready for the most insanely delicious meal of your life. The crispy crinkle cut fries are topped with tzatziki sauce, this red sauce (not quite sure what it is) and TONS of meat. Definitely hefty. <br><br>The gyros are also amazing but the hefty fries are unlike anything I've ever tasted before. Their meat is more minced rather than the traditional strip that gyro meat is usually in which definitely sets it apart from other gyro spots.<br><br>I usually get the traditional gyro meat (a mixture of lamb and beef) for my Pita and Hefty fries but I was sharing some things with my mom tonight at Elk Grove Food Truck Mania and she doesn't eat beef so we had to get both the fries and pita with chicken. Initally, I was bummed but decided to try it out. Safe to say, I WAS NOT dissapointed! The chicken was amazing and all the flavors in the pita and fries went together so well. My mom and I are both in agreement that this was one of the most delicious meals we have ever had. <br><br>Also, the customer service is excellent! The gentleman who took my order (didn't get his name) was so nice and even gave me a free soda when I went back to get a second pita (no shame.) It feels good supporting genuinely kind people. <br><br>I count down the days to Elk Grove's food truck mania when they're a part of the lineup.

El Ajicito Food Truck,"Sacramento, CA",12/18/2015,5,"I am SO glad to have randomly found El Ajicito! Their food truck was parked in front of New Helvetia Brewing; since I'm a fan of food trucks and haven't heard of them before (and since I was intrigued to find out what ""Peruvian street food"" was) I decided to give them a try. I ordered the chicharron sandwich and the salchipapas. The lady who took my order was super friendly and my food was ready in less than 5 minutes- score!<br><br>The food... you guys, THE FOOD. The chicharron was deep fried pork with sweet potatoes mixed in with the other burger fixings. I didn't know how that taste combo would work but let me tell you, it works perfectly. My favorite was the salchipapas which was fried hot dog bits over french fries, with cheese and some of the most delicious condiments I've ever had- 2 different creamy savory sauces, one was a little sweet and the other was a little spicy. I guarantee I will get the salchipapas at any future visit to El Ajicito, they were SO damn good!<br><br>I highly recommend El Ajicito, give them a try if you see the truck! You can see where they're going to be on their FB page.

The empanadas were moist and really nice flavor. I also liked the side salsa. The lemon garlic fries with cheese were great! I like my fries in the softer side and these were perfect.

I have no complaints other than I wish they were a restaurant so I always knew where they were!! Prices were soo reasonable - the lomo saltado plate is $12 - and is a great food truck portion. Fries were $7 and 1 empanada is $5. Tax is included in the price and they accept credit card through four square. No complains - food came out hot and omg so tasty. The lomo saltado was amazing!!!

El Ajicito Food Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",3/1/2017,2,"Not the best I've had, in fact, maybe my least favorite. We had the lomo saltado and it left much to be desired. The onions were cut way too thin and the tomatoes weren't sautéed enough, both of which add tremendous value to the traditional dish, since they absorb the juices and are released as you're enjoying every bite (this dish lacked it in every sense). It also seemed as if the meat was precooked, which is never good with steak and it had a funny seasoning I couldn't put my finger on. The fries and portion were ok.

It was sliced up little sausages over a bed of fries, drizzled with two different sauces on different sides. My boyfriend loved his plate as well. The portions were generous. I was full after my meal but still was tempted to order more things off the menu just to try them. The people working there were very friendly, and when we didn't go back outside to get our food in time, someone came in and brought it to us so we could enjoy it hot. I would highly recommend checking this truck out if you see it on one of the breweries schedules!

Very disappointing, considering that's over half their menu! They should have at least placed some ""Sold Out"" signs to cover up those items, so that people are aware before getting in line.<br><br>I settled for the bulgogi skewer instead, which took yet another half hour to come out.

The sampler I chose consisted of their three proteins beef, chicken and pork. The pork in chile verde was my favorite, secondly the ""tinga"" chicken and lastly the beef. The beef was in some pseudo-birria sauce, ugh this could be so wrong, but just more tomato-y? It was pretty salty too; I wish it had more pzzas and it would have definitely taken me there.

We arrived as they were setting up and had a quick conversation on the way in to grab a beer. They were very friendly and gave us a quick rundown on what they did. It sounded like we were in for some solid tacos and we ended up with that and so much more. At first I was a little taken back at the price. Three tacos for $10.50 seemed steep. I confess I love tacos on the cheap like anyone else. Looking at the menu it was clear these weren't your average pedestrian mass produced tacos. We ordered up and headed back to our table when the nice young lady said she would be happy to bring our meals over to us when they were ready. In short order we had two taco trios to go with our tasty beers. <br><br>They make their own tortillas and press them fresh to order. My first bite was the braised beef shoulder with pickled onions and fresh cilantro. I was expecting a flavor explosion, but it wasn't there, instead the savory goodness of a well braised meat, properly seasoned with judicious use of the pickled onion and cilantro totally wowed me into submission. The fresh tortilla was excellent in taste and texture and provided the perfect foundation. I could hardly wait to take my next bite. In short order that taco was polished off and it was on to the next one. The shredded chicken with chipotle and chorizo was another delicious taco. The avocado salsa and the queso fresco all married together in a way that once again, no component shined above another. A perfect balance of flavors. I was excited to get to the final taco, and again was very impressed. The Chili Verde was very nicely done. The dice was more fine than expected, which worked out exceptionally well for a taco. The tomatillos, onions and garlic wove to another excellent balance of flavors. The cool crema was a nice contrast to the filling. Not sure where the recipes come from, but they were all so delicious. It makes me wonder if they are recipes that were handed down and subsequently elevated just a bit. Whatever the back story, trifecta of amazing taco goodness for the win! <br><br>I looked these folks up right away on social media. They are very active on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter. The currently operate in a pop up tent but there truck is nearly complete.

I was super pleased when my order was ready to see the fresh made tortillas and the super saucy filling. We shared 2 beef and 2 pork glorious tacos.

I ordered the combo meal, which came with spaghetti carbonara, zuppa toscana, cannoli, and a drink.<br><br>It was all amazing. The spaghetti noodles were very filling, and their flavor was incredible. Since I had ordered carbonara, the noodles were coated in tiny bits of scrambled eggs, prosciutto, tomato, shaved cheese, oil, and spices. Every single bite was perfect. My grandma was really good at cooking Italian food, and this tasted like something she would have made. <br><br>Zuppa toscana is normally not my favorite, but theirs won me over. I don't think it was supposed to come with the combo, but they were out of salad, so I just got lucky. <br><br>The cannoli was fresh. Even in Italian delis, it's hard to find cannoli this good. <br><br>Another reviewer complained about the portions.

Ma Sarap Food Truck,"Roseville, CA",8/11/2017,3,Filipino food in sacramento! Was pretty excited to see that this truck would be at the Roseville food truck event . My fiancé is Filipino so I've had my fair share of the food. All of he plates are around $10 with appetizers also on the menu. We went with the sisig with pancit and rice. I've had sisig here in the states and in the Philippines. The pork had an overall good taste to it but they put soooooo much soy sauce on it. To he point where it tasted like salty Chinese food. The peppers they put in it were really good though. The pancit saved the dish. Very flavorful with good textures and veggies. We drank soooo much water trying to get through the sisig though . I wish I had taken a picture of the bottom of the container so you could see what I am talking about .,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ca_HRiEHIhah6WAYTGUNAA

Their menu included photos of the entrees, which is helpful for anyone not familiar with the different items offered. I chose the pork sisig, which came with a side of the pancit (noodles) and white rice. The meat was moderately spicy and a little heavy on the salt, but still good when mixed with the plain rice. The slices of chili pepper on top of the meat were a bit too hot so I picked some of those out. I also tried the lumpia, thin and crispy fried rolls of meat, which were very tasty.

Corn does not belong in a lumpia and the lumpia was oily. We had to soak up four napkins of oil from two lumpias.

Masa Guisería,"Valencia, CA",6/21/2016,1,"This is in reply to the response from Alex at Masa. Neither me, nor my husband, are friends with the owners of Guisados. We have met the owner and his son because they are also a family run business, and therefore we have seen them while patronizing their establishments. Never, ever, not even once, have we socialized with the owners of Guisados outside of that. To blame my review on that is in poor taste. Rather you can behave like a mature adult, take constructive criticism, and grow from it. Try to make improvements. Learn from feedback. You'll need to have much thicker skin if you plan on surviving this restaurant game. Not everyone is going to love your food. You won't always impress. People have different experiences in life. Different tastes. Different expectations. I'm sorry I was your first negative review. I'm sure I won't be your last. And, by the way, I find it interesting that you accuse me of writing a biased review for a friend, when your friends have obviously reviewed you, since the reviewers know you by name, your work history, background info, etc. They even jumped to your defense once I wrote my review, writing good reviews and sending me private comments. Interesting double standard. Again, I'm in no way associated with Guisados. I just love good tacos and good food in general. I used to be a food blogger, and as you can see by my Yelp page, I review many restaurants with a wide variety of ratings. My husband is from LA, but Mexican and Honduran by blood, and the man loves tacos almost as much as he loves me, so we scour every area looking for the best. As far as other social media, I've never even commented or posted on any of your social media sites, unless ""liking"" your pics counts. My husband tagged Guisados on one of your Instagram photos, that's it. And you have since blocked us. Is this the harassment of which you speak? If you were confident in your products and its authenticity and originality, you'd have no reason to be so defensive.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WII18mn-4xAj4vYMg2CAVg

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Granite Bay, CA",2/1/2015,5,"Wow. Ran into these guys today in Carmichael at Parish Dentistry and was I ever shocked! I had no idea food from a truck could be this good! <br>I got the Lemon chicken pattymelt, my wife got the Peruvian fries and my daughter, the grilled crab Mac and cheese sandwich. Hadn't had any of these things before and they were amazing. I highly recommend hitting this truck up if you see it anywhere. Awesome. <br>My only tip would be, if you don't like cilantro, make sure to ask them to skip it on the Peruvian fries. Seems like most people Love or hate cilantro. Being the latter myself, I wished I had known it came on them so I didn't have to dig around it. <br>All in all, great experience.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=eWgysZMexjQFcqUEsl_IEQ
Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"San Jose, CA",8/14/2016,4,"I got to sample some of Flavor Face's food at a Yelp event and it was pretty bomb. We got to try the crab mac and cheese grilled cheese and watermelon salad. The crab mac and cheese grilled cheese was super yummy. The bread was crispy, albeit quite greasy. The crab added so much flavor and deliciousness. The watermelon salad was ok, I think they used arugula and maybe I'm not a huge fan of arugula. And maybe I don't have a sophisticated enough palate for this haha. But the watermelon was SUPER juicy, sweet, and ripe. I wish they just gave out the watermelon by itself!

I ended up calling the flavor face truck 3 times and didn't get a call back. I called a fourth and finally got in touch with somebody. They said they would be out in Roseville for the last concert with Sactomofo. Awesome! Finally! I rounded up some friends and family and headed out to Roseville.

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Rancho Cordova, CA",7/16/2015,5,"Flavor Face has to be one of my favorite food trucks. Yesterday, at the Folsom Food Truck event at Lions Park, I had the pleasure of trying the food from Flavor Face. Having been a weekly regular at the Tuesday event at Anatolia, I have eaten at almost all of the other trucks there. I had never come across Flavor Face before and was intrigued by the menu. It was simple in a good way. The way that conveyed a sense of ""we focus on these 8 or so items"" rather than a whole bunch of different items. <br><br>I ordered a French drip burger, chicken philly and hot link fries. <br><br>The burger was outstanding. To paraphrase the gentleman from the truck - it's a take on a burger and French onion soup combined.  The flavor was on point and I loved how the beef patty felt when I ate it. It melted in my mouth. If the patty wasn't hand formed, it sure seemed like it was. <br><br>My wife had the chicken philly but I stole a few bites. It was also terrific. Just the right amount of pepper to pass along flavor and some heat with out overdoing it. <br><br>The hot link fries were also very good but they are more of a meal on thief own rather than a side of fries. <br><br>Bonus- the burger and sandwich cans with what I suspect are homemade potato chips.

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Sacramento, CA",10/16/2014,3,"I order the tough, but easy Char Siu Pork Belly Slider, easy because I am Asian descent and my family is known for roasted meats. I did not like this sandwich. First, it was advertised, ""Char Siu Pork ""Belly"" Sandwich"" but I discovered the cut to be a Boston Butt; No way was that cut a pork belly. The slider was like $8.00 with house chips. Kinda steep for a Boston Butt. When I chomped down on that slider, I had noticed notes of sour, salty and sweet. In my honest opinion, it was not a good symphony and not well balanced. The Char Siu Pork ""Butt"" (I would of just called it a Char Siu Pork Sandwich as Char Siu is typically made with a Boston Butt) Sandwich is 2/5 at most.<br><br>I also order the Soft Shell Crab sandwich. That was nice. But I think the slaw killed it. The slaw and the butter of the soft shell crab did not go in harmony, although different and tasty, I think something needs to change here.<br><br>My final verdict is this truck is, ""aight"". In the vehicular of the Anglo-Saxons, this truck is mediocre. I believe the chef himself has some things he needs to work on and needs to pay more attention on how his meal presents itself on the palate. Other than that, this guy can become a new Sacramentian top chef.<br><br>On a good note... They have this Green Garlic Hot Sauce that I like. Shiza is fuego. I suspect it is a tomatillo based.

It is an invasive species of America, suspected to be brought here by South East Asians.<br><br>Kay S - You should read my Taco Bell comment again. It was a joke review for laughs. A MC chicken at Taco Bell? You are smart. And why so defensive? Did you get paid to boost the rating and is your report bias?

Flavor Face Mobile Food & Catering,"Sacramento, CA",7/27/2015,1,"What a huge disappointment. Note that this review is for their catering, not the food alone. The food is great, which prompted us to inquire about them catering our wedding next May (we're having several trucks provide all the food for a fun, cocktail style reception). At first, Brian (chef) was super excited to participate and had a ""sky's the limit"" attitude when it came to food options. It quickly became clear, however, that he could not handle the business side of things. He would take weeks to respond to e-mails, we would set up tasting dates and he would bail, etc. etc. <br><br>Then along came his girlfriend, Michelle (who wrote their first review on Yelp, by the way - classy), who was going to handle all the e-mail and contract negotiations for us. She was much more responsive, seemingly organized, and pretty helpful. That is until about four months went by and we still didn't have a contract. She had given us a per person cost, but balked when we asked for a breakdown including tax, setup, etc. - basically anything that a real contract would include.<br><br>At this point, Michelle started making up excuses, not responding to e-mails/text messages, and behaving rather oddly. I got the sense that she and Brian had either broken up, or were simply backing out of the catering idea but not willing to tell us. It took multiple phone calls and e-mails from our wedding planner and myself before she finally responded with a short ""Sorry, we won't be able to cater your wedding"" e-mail. Months of e-mails, calls, and shooting menus back and forth and working toward a contract, and then a short e-mail backing out. How terribly unprofessional. Never mind the previous unprofessional things that I had been willing to overlook, like her accidentally texting me things meant for Brian, and their complete disregard for timelines, e-mail etiquette, and schedule commitments. That they couldn't produce an actual contract also makes me wonder about their integrity and ability to honestly come up with a price for their food and services.<br><br>In short, there is absolutely no infrastructure in this company to handle catering as their name suggests, and I would warn anyone pursuing them that it is not worth the headache and stress. After many months of being led on, I can confidently say that your money and time are better spent elsewhere.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yzIL0RSYuLyngVAQSGfvcg

Our uber can't usually get past 15th street, so we opt to walk from there. <br>-You have to get drink tokens at one tent and then go get in a different line to get drinks at another tent. DO THIS FIRST THING--the lines get loooonng. However, I have found that they move pretty quickly. <br>-Check out the amazing food trucks! The falafel/gyro truck is delish!<br>-If you want to sit down, remember to bring a towel/blanket of some sort to sit on the grass! <br>-Make sure to check out the adorable boutique on wheels!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=hoCt01C3Sk8ynMMKRHCXTg
Concerts In the Park,"Sacramento, CA",6/27/2018,5,"Who doesn't love FREE? I don't usually go to these concerts just because I usually don't know the bands on the line ups. However, I seen a reggae band on the line up this year (2018) so my hubby and I decided to check it out. <br><br>Of course when I hear the word FREE I just think of the huge crowd that the power of that one single word can draw out! This onetime was no exception but it wasn't as rowdy as I imagined. There was order to this chaos!<br><br>Some tips I would recommend is (1) arrive early to find decent street parking, (2) get your beer and alcohol tokens early as lines get ridiculously long and (3)pick a good spot near the stage so you can see the acts. <br><br>Also lots of good food vendors too!

Concerts In the Park,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",6/12/2018,3,"Concerts In The Park at Cesar Chavez Park is still a great addition to summer in Sacramento, but it has slipped over the years. It is still held every Friday evening at Cesar Chavez Park between 10th and 11th and I and J Streets. Parking is not available at the event, but you can easily walk from light rail or downtown offices. <br><br>The event is free for everyone. This is a nice benefit to the region allowing for a nice open air concert. Being outside can be a gamble. A beautiful delta breeze one week can turn into a smoggy heat wave the next. The music is eclectic and usually fun for the audience ranging from babies to the elderly all enjoying the music. <br><br>Unfortunately, the food and drink options have deteriorated. The event is now sponsored by Budweiser so the drinks are all industrial brews, although they have some Bogle wine and limited cocktails. Food is also limited to a few food trucks with the typical greasy and meat heavy options popular in the suburbs. <br><br>The token system is a bit weird in an era of square and Apple Pay. Fortunately the portable toilets were clean, and La Cosecha is open too. Seating can be tough with limited grass space, but the fountain is run in again acting as a weak mister for the area. <br><br>Live music is always nice, especially in Downtown Sacramento. However, Concerts In The Park is suffering from some growing pains. This is expected somewhat due to pressures to keep the event free through sponsors and cost control. It still may be cheaper to hit up a local bar for happy hour and mosey over later in the evening.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA
Concerts In the Park,"Yuba City, CA",,5,"REVIEW FOR CONCERTS IN THE PARK <br>At Cesar Chavez Plaza in Downtown Sacramento<br><br>This is my first year attending the free concert series at Cesar Chavez Plaza in Downtown Sacramento. First off, I became an infomercial for PEPSI ONE located on the outer perimeter. Upon entering the venue, I am so impressed by how clean and safe and upscale it is! The entire park is fenced in with only two entrances. There's police presence, security check, and free bike valet. There are also clean porta potties with water &amp; soap station. All paid for by the City of Sacramento. <br><br>I won an Alternative 94.7fm Radio shopping tote and a deluxe wine bottle opener from BOGLE VINEYARDS by playing their tossing games. Free wine &amp; beer tasting as well!  And if you are hungry, international food trucks serving a range of food from hot tamales to Indian curry to gyros to shave ice cones for your culinary appetite. <br><br>Held every Friday between 5:00pm - 9:00pm from the beginning of May till the end of July.<br><br>So far, I have attended four events from the series:<br><br>CONCERTS IN THE PARK - Friday, May 25, 2018 - with One Leg Chuck &amp; The Hustle, Casey Haley, Mike Love<br><br>CONCERTS IN THE PARK - Friday, June 8, 2018 - with Drop Dead Red, Peter Perry, and DJ Elements<br><br>CONCERTS IN THE PARK - Friday, June 15, 2018 - with Element of Soul<br><br>CONCERTS IN THE PARK - Friday, June 22, 2018 - with NERV &amp; Dance Gavin Dance<br><br>Each Friday events carry a different theme.  May 25 was reggae, while June 8 progressive rock band, r&amp;b dj,  and jivvy swing orchestra with a touch of modern funk.  I was so impressed by the band NERV!  It's like watching Linkin Park up close for free!  I plan to attend many more.  A great place to relax, getaway and enjoy good music with friendly people!  <br><br>As the weather gets hotter, the crowd becomes larger and the band much cooler!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=h9SeCKbSyD93YQpgsGt6Hg
Bacon MANia Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",5/30/2018,3,"So this truck has been on campus several times, but I hadn't been able to actually try it up until fairly recently at the Sac Fry Fest.<br><br>Their menu consists of all that is pork in the form of bacon ~ sandwiches, fries, mac n cheese, and more. This review will be purely for the Piggyback fries, which is what I sampled at the Sac Fry Fest.<br><br>The Piggyback fries consists of slow roasted pulled pork with bacon, barbeque sauce, and Louisiana slaw served on a bed of crispy shoestring potatoes and topped with chipotle sour cream. It was pretty good, I'm a fan of BBQ sauce so it really set the flavors together with the saltiness of the fries and bacon. After a while though I began to feel myself slow down when it came to eating this, probably because of the heavy salt and oils. <br><br>It was a good portion size, but it was still pretty pricey. I probably paid about $10 for a sample lol. It was a bit on the heavy side, and I couldn't even finish it to save my life lol.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=argaX4ADH_Wczq2ZUPYLNw

Bacon MANia Truck,"Sacramento, CA",5/17/2017,3,"Bacon mania is some of my favorite things mixed together! The only things I've ever gotten here were the bacon and mac and the mac over fries. Both were really good. I've eaten at this truck probably 3-4 times. One time when they came to my school for lunch, they gave me the smallest portion of the bacon and mac, it's usually more but I think they were running out or being stingy that day, hence a few stars off L And another time they came to my school, they ran out of fries and the mac? Like...?<br><br> <br><br>The food-<br><br>The food is good, the mac and cheese is creamy and there is a pretty good amount of bacon in the mac. The mac over fries is pretty good as well but the fries we got were a little cold and hard once we got to the bottom so we just tossed the rest.<br><br> <br><br>The service-<br><br>I mean, it's a food truck so they're always quick. Nothing excellent or notable here but I've definitely had great service at other food trucks so I think this is somewhere bacon mania could step up.<br><br> <br><br>The location-<br><br>They've come to pretty convenient places, like my school, my job and other events that have a bunch of food trucks. I've never tried to look for them myself but I think they could be pretty accessible if you look on their social media. They did give us flyers a couple of times that we ate here. I think they could benefit from opening a brick and mortar store!<br><br> <br><br>Overall, I really do get pretty excited when I know bacon mania is going to be at an event because I usually get a bunch of things and split it with my friends or whomever I'm with.

I ordered the Penne with Prosciutto, which was hot with freshly grated Parmesan on on top. When I opened it, I could smell the cheese and bacon which was grouped on top of the pasta. I tried tossing to mix everything up, and discovered a small lake of water at the bottom. The pasta could have been drained a little more. This watered-down the sauce making it taste like prosciutto in hot water. No flavor at all for the most part. I then discovered what I think were dried mushrooms that weren't hydrated properly giving them the consistency of plastic wafers. Maybe their pizza is a better choice.

Last night was au contraire as we have been having needed rains. But the rain held off last night! Yay! Hubby even found parking within a block of the venue. Another plus!!!<br><br>As you enter into CIP they ask if you're drinking or not so there were two different lines. If you know us you would know what line we were in! I was really glad I was dressed for a cool night. Most times I get cold easily.  As you enter there were food trucks galore.  I didn't pay too much attention except for Yolanda's Tamales which is our favorite. It was three dollars for one pork tamale but they were substantial and very flavorful.<br><br>I knew that James Cavern was headlining the night so he would be playing last. Wasn't sure if we would make the entire night but yes we were there for a majority of it. Current Personae and Tessa Evans were amazing to listen and dance to though we left the dancing to Kenny the dancing Sacramento guy.  If you were there you would know what I mean. DJ Epik kept us entertained in between acts.<br><br>What was really on point was James brought out the previous performers to sing with him. He even had local talented Inland where Cindy sang so beautifully! Yeah! Love outdoors live music. It was actually the kind of music I love listening to. So soulful and raw!<br><br>What's a definite plus is that these concerts are free and opened to the public. I saw that people brought their chairs.if you don't want to stand all night. They do have portapotties too. <br>If you live close by and have a bike then bike down here as they have a place for you to park your bike. That's so smart as parking can be a pain though we really lucked out!!! Last night was the opening night of the season. It's every Friday from May to July 2016. It's hard to believe that it has been going strong for 25 years!!! Wow time flies!!!,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pjxgZ_tjfP4xibXL3jofPg

Bacon MANia Truck,"San Francisco, CA",5/5/2016,5,"Well, you can never have too much bacon.  These guys are serious!  Bacon Mania is one of the new vendors for the 2016 season at Off The Grid Fort Mason, basically filling the void left by the Bacon Bacon Truck.  What I like about Bacon Mania is how their food is completely different from what Bacon Bacon had to offer, so there really shouldn't be any comparison with the two trucks.  In my honest opinion though, I like Bacon Mania a whole lot better!<br><br>First thing that you should know is that the majority of the menu includes their award-winning Mac n' Bacon either as a topping, a stuffing, a side, or a standalone dish.  It's baked with Sharp Cheddar Cheese, Hickory Smoked Bacon, had has a little spicy kick to it as well. <br><br>With that being said, let's talk about their Mac 'n Bacon Fries.<br><br>Mac n' Bacon Fries -- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F23Rjs1W&amp;s=604d05b978b34887ca93f7dbdc66e205f9f8c9b11e231d102f86467dbf9749b2"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/23Rjs1W</a><br>Shoestring fries topped with Mac n' Bacon<br>Oh man!!  I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I ordered this.  Just look at the pic and see that this is the motherload of all things with fries, cheese, and bacon.  It's a humongous portion!!  Basically, if you're going to Off The Grid alone, this is your one-and-done dish for the night.  And oh yeah, this was delicious!!!  A great way to celebrate FryDays.<br><br>Because with my first visit being a carb overload, it had me going back again the very next week because I had to try their Jack Back Sammie which is an inside out grilled cheese sandwich.  So basically, they take the whole sandwich and press it on the grill while at the same time grilling a huge amount of cheese on the grill to create a cheese 'wrap' which is then used to wrap around the sandwich.  Whoa!  I decided to go big and have the American Jack Back which is stuffed with a beef and bacon burger patty inside.<br><br>American Jack Back Sammie -- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1Vcuu0b&amp;s=978ee72e076c27ced3d5f97834b64c71e3c7b930ff3d00ec96b09ab79600cdb4"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1Vcuu0b</a><br>Twice-grilled cheese sandwich stuffed with 50/50 Angus beef &amp; bacon patty<br>Yeah, I've had some really dangerously delicious burgers in my time, and this one ranks up there with the best of them.  The burger itself was juicy and had a good smoked flavor from the bits of bacon in the patty, almost like the burger from RickyBobby.  But the real star of this sandwich was the cheese 'wrap'.  Every bite was heavenly because the whole sandwich was covered in the melted grilled cheese.  This is a huge sandwich too and should be shared if you're at Off The Grid.  But if you're a hungry dude like me, go for it all!<br><br>Avocado Sliders (OTG Fort Mason Exclusive) -- <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1QgRBOY&amp;s=8a9bdf666af6810b604a9a4bba2461e943ddc20c547dfda8116fc31a2422c4a9"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">bit.ly/1QgRBOY</a><br>Grilled avocado topped with Mac n' Bacon, with side of bacon topped Carolina slaw.<br>I thought this one was a bit of a disappointment.  It was pretty much just their Mac 'n Bacon with avocado and slaw. Not to say that that's a bad thing, because their Mac n' Bacon is awesome already, but I guess I tried it expecting something creative and different but ended up having something I've tried before but with avocado added.  Oh well, it was still good nonetheless.  Like I said earlier, you can never have too much bacon.<br><br>Aside from the Avocado Sliders, everything I've had from Bacon Mania is awesome and worth trying at least once if you're at Off The Grid Fort Mason.  Their food is pretty outrageous with the bacon and they don't hold back with the portion size.  If you only have to order one thing from this truck, I definitely recommend getting their Mac n' Bacon as a standalone since that's really their signature item, but if you're want to be a little more bold, the Mac n' Bacon Fries is the way to go.  <br><br>Mmm.....BACON!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=F_5_UNX-wrAFCXuAkBZRDw

It's only $5 after 5pm which is great! I would recommend getting here early before it gets really packed. My only negative would be that there isn't really too much for kids to do.

Bacon MANia Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",4/16/2016,4,"Bacon Mania has been on my ""bucket list"" for a couple years.  I remember going to the very first Sactomofo and discovering that their truck broke down and they weren't coming, I was crushed.  But have no fear, just four short years later, I finally managed to get to their truck.  (I know, I'm not on the ball.)<br><br>We got to the Sactomofo West Elk Grove event around 5:40pm and there were not a lot of people there yet which was AMAZING.  I think I stood in line for less than 10 mins and then waited less than 5 mins for my sandwich/burger.  The guys were really nice.  I didn't feel rushed to ""get through the line"" but I felt that they were really efficient, a good balance.  <br><br>I ordered a Famous Jack Back Sammie and the guy taking my order recommended getting the one with the burger patty.  I figured since I was splitting it with my hubby, why not?  Oh my gosh, it was SO good!  I LOVED the crispy cheese on the outside!  The burger patty was SO delicious!  And I was really impressed that even with all the cheese and bacon, they managed to control the saltiness.  I've had a certain burger with tons of cheese grilled on to it from another place and it was VERY salty to me.  I had concerns about this sandwich from Bacon Mania but I didn't find it to be too salty at all.  <br><br>The only thing keeping me from 5 stars is the price.  While the sandwich was large, $14 still felt like a lot for just a sandwich/burger and no drink or side.  However, that won't stop me from coming back.  I'm excited to try the Mac and Bacon next time.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=anPNIUo-9Qza-R1eJgiHJA
Bacon MANia Truck,"Pittsburg, CA",10/26/2015,4,"Right on Bacon Mania, Right Friggin On! They totally got it right here. And im glad to finally see this place at OTG Concord after hearing rave reviews and seeing it appear on various food network tv shows and such. Let me get this review rolling by saying....Who has a Bacon Tooth?<br><br>Kinda like a sweet tooth, to some eating bacon is smililar. The crispy, greasy, hammy goodness makes most things just taste..better, and here at Bacon MANia they just continue to prove this fact. There is just something special about people dedicated to satisfying peoples ""bacon tooth"" and boy is mine big. Im just happy I didn't have to go all the way to Sacramento to see them. Their menu ranges from Bacon Mac &amp; Cheese to Specialty Sandwiches where of course Bacon is the ""STAR"" here....man I'm still excited as I type this review and eat. And the Bacon covered french fries in which I'm eating now....faint..okay revive. Let's talk about pricing and service a bit..<br><br>The prices are pretty fair. Ranging from about 5 bucks to about 15 bucks. Some may think that sound expensive but keep in mind, this is a food truck restaurant on wheels, take in gas, supplies, and the food they're preparing which I'm sure uses propane. I don't mind paying the prices. But the food has to be amazing.....and amazing it is here. The service was decent, the girl at the counter seen me taking my pics and asked if I was a Yelper....and then proceeded to ignore me when I walked up to order and took the customer behind me order....WTH..you just asked me if I'm a Yelper..did you think I wasn't hoing to mention this in the review? For Shame! But, I forgive her just this once...because the food totally makes up for it.<br><br>On this visit I had the ""ChiCheese Fries"" basically chilli cheese fries with of course Bacon made into the chilli, cheese, grilled onions and tomatoes and of course......""MORE BACON!"" nom nom nom nom nom. And some type of beef in here too. They were 11bucks plus two for the soda, so 13 bucks in total. Now I'm full and I still have a try of food, these meal weighs in at about 10 - 11oz btw....WOW! Insane yo!<br><br>In conclusion, you don't have to just see them on TV anymore, come and live the madness that is OTG and Bacon MANia, and try the food for yourself. If you're a lover of bacon you can't go wrong with them.

I can't wait for this truck to make its rounds again so that I can try the Grilled Cheese with the cheesiness grilled on both the inside and the outside. Say whaaaaat???<br><br>My coworker and I were looking to split something delish from the Capitol Farmer's Market (every Thursday on Capitol Mall amid swarms of hungry state workers), and this Bacon Art Wrapped Truck caught our eye. I ordered the Bacon burger with Bacon Mac. Yes that is bacon mac n' cheese tucked inside a perfectly prepared and marinated burger, with tomato, lettuce, and onion to boot. Add a side of fries and VOILA! Instant heart attack. Had to be shareable because I am no longer allowed to eat like I used to due to, ya know, health and stuff. <br><br>I do not understand how a person, let alone two people, would be expected to fit this burger into their mouth(s). It comes on texas toast style bread, which I didn't care for with a burger, personally. It was absolutely perfect other than that.

Serving up Indian food. I found it to be kinda odd but hey- as long as the food is good, who cares?! But it wasn't. I got the masala fries and the chicken Frankie. The frozen French fries were dropped fresh but was doused in too much masala powder. And came with ketchup. I think switching to a more interesting dip or Indian style sauce would make those fries on point! I moved on to the Frankie which came out after the fries cuz she's only one person and can only do so much at the same time! I honestly thought the chicken was going to make me ill because it just tasted ... not fresh. It was a let down. If the chicken would have been fresh with some diced onions, seasoned cucumbers and tomatoes it would have been hella good! With a side of green chutney sauce. But that's not what you get.

Hefty Gyros,"Olivehurst, CA",3/12/2018,5,Update review! Just cause Hefty Gyro added a new menu item. Which has become my new favorite food item of all time now. They added "steak on a bed of rice" and I won't lie. I have been eating it everyday since they added it to the menu. Hefty Gyros at Beale AFB is the most delicious food around. I thought i was crazy that is until I brought a plate of it to my GF. She now has me bring a plate of "Steak and rice" every friday before I leave work at Beale AFB. Hefty Gyros is now our friday night dinner food. Keep up the delicious work guys. Looking forward to any new creations that you guys come up with.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=yrxwZV1o1EfX1Z3wcstfuA
Hefty Gyros,"Roseville, CA",,5,"Hefty Gyros came to my apartment complex last Friday.  Their food on their menu looks really.  My son and I ordered the chicken pita and the special fries.  The taste and the quality of the chicken pita was delicious. The food was nice and hot when it was given to us. The chicken and the ingredients on the pita was nice and fresh. The specialty fries is excellent. If you ever come to see this food truck, you will have to try their award-winning fries. I hope they come to my apartment complex again or hope to find them around the area.

I almost got a sandwich at a different truck, but at the last second I decided to give Hefty a shot. I made the right decision. My wife had the falafel on rice and I had the hefty fries, and we shared a baklava for dessert. Each item was awesome. For mine the fries were perfect, meat was delicious, and it had the perfect amount of red and white sauce. My only change would be chopping the peppers put on top a bit finer. My wife's dish was amazing as well. It initially looked like they went overboard on the sauce, but once it was stirred in it was the perfect amount. The baklava tasted great, but the texture was the best feature. All in all, very satisfied.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ut9IUGD4TgReUherKE4yDg

I would like to shake the hand of whoever thought up that brilliance. Really glad the fries were crispy and not soggy.

However due to mechanical issues they couldn't make it out and instead sent Hefty Gyros. I was pleasantly surprised to say the least. I ordered the Gyro on Rice with extra salad and less rice.

Gyro 2 Go,"Sacramento, CA",7/7/2015,5,"Of all the long standing food vendors at the farmer's markets, Gyro 2 Go is the best!! It's evident in the extremely long line to order, the longest of any food vendor at the markets. I love their halal gyro with rice, which comes with lettuce (a little side salad), white yogurt sauce, and sriracha. The meat is very tender and flavorful and goes really well with the basmati rice. It's very filling, but if you are craving something a little smaller, you can order the same dish in sandwich form. And by sandwich, I mean the same ingredients wrapped in a delicious warmed pita bread. It's really great for lunch! You can also choose tandoori chicken meat instead of gyro meat. I've been ordering lunch from this vendor for years and have not been disappointed. <br><br>I've seen Gyro 2 Go at the Wednesday farmer's market at Cesar Chavez Plaza, the Thursday Capitol Mall farmer's market, and Fridays at Concert in the Park. When it's lunchtime, the lines are usually the longest at Gyro 2 Go, which says something good about their food. The only slightly negative part is having to wait in a long line to order on a hot summer day. Although once you order, the food is ready pretty quickly.  <br><br>This year, the price of the gyro or chicken with rice is $7.75 and comes with a soda or water. The price of the sandwich is $7. The price keeps going up each year, but I still want my gyro from Gyro 2 Go as it is the best! <br><br>And on a side note, the workers there are not shabby on the eyes.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Hj9gGdI2Iz5gmsorFVYyow

My guess is that you probably want to get the actually gyro. Not being a fan of lamb, I got the chicken pita. It's only ok. The most disappointing part is that there were only 5 small pieces of chicken on it. Seems a bit overpriced for the lack of meat.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=of0sXo1IchabrOuVjZdQvQ

I ordered their lamb and beef gyro, and they easily became one of the top 3 gyros I have ever eaten in my life. The white sauce that they used was the perfect texture and taste. Not too heavy, not too bland. Thinking about it right now is making me hungry. The guy who served us wasn't too social or friendly, but I'll let that go because he looked like he had an extremely long day. I can sympathize. I wish I knew where their weekly whereabouts were, but I'm reading that they're hard to find. I might have to try and hunt them down at the next farmers market, because they are just that good.

You can get gyro, chicken, or falafel in either of these forms; all items come with a free canned soda or bottled water.  The sandwich is basically a pita with onion, lettuce, tomato, and yogurt sauce.  ""Over rice"" is the same vegetables served more like a salad on one side with the protein on the other, all on a bed of seasoned basmati.  If you get it ""spicy"" they drizzle sriracha on the whole thing.  By the time I get back to the office, it's a withered horrible mess--a delicious, withered, horrible mess that I have been scarfing down nearly every Wednesday for the past three months.<br><br>I'm sure there are other places the Gyro guys will set up shop and efficiently dole out their delectable sodium-laden goodies, but none so close to the office.  Thus the season changes to make way for equally fattening fare.  See you in May, Gyro 2 Go!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=q_Ut8HBElVOGcHBJpJOr_A

I finally stopped in for lunch and got a huge gyro sandwich with halal gyro meat (lamb and beef with spices), tomatoes, lettuce, white sauce and sriracha. The sandwich and a can of cold pop cost me exactly $5 and it was completely worth it. The guy working heated the pita and the meat up on a griddle and then assembled the whole works and wrapped it up like a Chipotle burrito (and it was almost as big). He also had various chicken and falafal options and you could get it all over seasoned rice instead of in a pita. The gyro I got was really tasty. Hot, spicy meat, crunchy veg and cool white sauce, all wrapped up in a toasted pita: pretty hard to beat. <br><br>I find it mildly ironic that there's never a line at this place which serves delicious and relatively healthy fare every day in a cool setting (McKinley Park, to the right of the library) yet people waited in line for hours to eat at the food trucks at SactoMofo.

Voyager World Cuisine,"Modesto, CA",3/14/2017,5,"My mom happened to find this delicious food truck while looking up info for Bike Dog Brewery. We went on a whim while on our way to the bowling alley. Let's just say it was amazing and I am so glad my mom looked into it!<br><br>We ordered the following: <br>cuban sandwich w/fruit salad and fries - very flavorful<br>fried chicken sandwich - crispy chicken, not greasy, extra points for homemade pickles<br>bahnmi sandwich w/quinoa - juicy chicken thighs and crunchy veggies<br>brussel sprouts - sweet and hot, crunchy, deep fried deliciousness<br><br>Everything was AMAZING and delicious! Though there was somewhat of a line (see Sac Beer Week and being parked outside a brewery) the wait was very reasonable and so worth it. There was nowhere to sit inside Brew Dog (see Beer Week) but we were fine camping out in the family van.

Voyager World Cuisine,"Rancho Cordova, CA",5/13/2017,4,"Came here for lunch on a Friday. The food trucks are always near work. I had a hard time choosing between the jerk chicken burrito or cubano sandwich. I like how they offer you a choice of fruit or potato salad. The sandwich was filled with tons of yummy pulled pork and the fruit salad had  strawberries, blueberries, watermelon and kiwi.Wait, what, kiwi? I love the fruit combo and glad they didn't use grapes. I hate grapes in fruit salad or in a fruit mix. The sandwich was tasty with the pulled pork, pickles and nice toasty bread. I would order this again and I will have to try the jerk chicken burrito next time.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8GrR8ZAh_z1cZDBuhA3Zfw

BEST choice that I made. I got the cubano which was absolutely wonderful. The interplay of the garlic aioli and mustard with the braised park, pickle slices, and the crunch of toasted bread was just amazing. I would definitely recommend.

Bacon MANia Truck,"Sacramento, CA",5/2/2014,4,"I was SO glad to have finally tried the Bacon Mania truck, especially since the recent SactoMoFo was unseasonably chilly for a late Sacramento April. After standing in line for 20-30 minutes freezing my chi-chis off, I happily ordered the ChiChee Fries and the Chili Mac. <br><br>I split the food with my 2 girlfriends. The general consensus was 1) you get a generous portion for what you pay, 2) the ChiChee Fries were OK but nothing to write home about, and 3) the Chili Mac was so good that I'd write home about it... a letter's worth and possibly a short novela. It was a piping hot bowl of mac n cheese with bacon mixed in, and the bottom of the bowl was layering with hot chili with just a slight spice kick to it. It was perfect for the weather, and I declare it Summer's Best of Show Winner for SactoMofo April 2014.<br><br>Keep dat bacon hot and on hand, Bacon Mania, cuz I shall return!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O8ZV9zJDXq81MT_XM_63Hw

So happy to finally spend my $20 certificate on pig paradise! <br><br>I opted for the Piggy Back pulled pork sliders and for $7.50 you get a fairly substantial serving. The sourdough buns are filling - and they to tend to absorb a lot of the pulled pork juice, so it's great that forks are also provided. With coleslaw on it to boot, it proved to be tasty, but a tad on the salty side for me. Was there bacon? I couldn't tell although it was supposed to be in there. <br><br>Also tried the All American sliders for $7.50, these babies definitely had bacon as well as a melting of cheddar cheese on top. The meat pattie tended to be more well done than I would've liked, but better on the cooked side than raw. Definitely filling. For me at least, one order did me in. Mind you, I COULD have eaten more but didn't want to push the limit.<br><br>Lastly, had the Cinni Bites. Small cinnamon donut holes wrapped with bacon and deep fried. For $5, you get three with a side of whipped cream. Now THIS was IT. This is what I had been wanting all along. Heck if you're gonna have death by bacon, you gotta start here. <br><br>Since I got my cholesterol tested and I'm considered ""borderline"" (and not in a good Madonna-song way) I shouldn't eat here more than once or twice a year.

They were SUPER tasty but the skinny fries didn't hold up well to all of the meaty goodness. Steak fries would be a better option.<br>- Sliders: these had pulled pork, BBQ sauce, chipayo and COLE SLAW! YUM! I wish I could eat wheat because one bite was not enough. The bread was soft and the cole slaw perfectly balanced the spicy BBQ sauce.

Btw, she gave me hella attitude because I told her I didn't know because I could see the menu because it was dark and they had no lights. So she said its right here, just use your phone. Whatever, that's what I was already going to do when I got up there. The first person in line had to reorder. The second person told us to go first because they were waiting on someone, we ordered but she said she already took my order down when she took the inventory. So it took like five mins for her to understand our whole order which was just two fries and a Mac. Then the person that let us go first said their order but she told them that she already put down their order when she did inventory and they no longer can change their order because she's cooking it.

Bacon MANia Truck,"Lincoln, CA",6/9/2015,3,"The sauce on the pizza is NOT for everyone. I would sample it first. The rest of the food made my stomach smile. :-) even the debated Mac n cheese. I am still young in my Bacon Following, but I know 1 thing for sure, when I see BACON I get in line. <br><br>After waiting the standard 20 minutes to make my way up to the window, I ordered the Pizza which I had trouble pronouncing, fortunately the order taker seemed to be plenty used to it. He didn't even skip a beat. I opted for the ""make it a meal"" up grade for $4.00 extra. Total order was $14.00. This included my pizza, bacon mac n cheese, and a can of soda.<br><br>After a few minutes passed I heard my name, scooped up my platter, and headed over to the standing table that was already occupied by my family. I was eyeing my food all the way to my table and was anxious to chow down. <br><br>-The pizza: It was unfortunately not my taste. It had a strong Worcestershire-y, almost vinegary zing to it that just killed it for me. Keep in mind I also recently realized I do not care for buffalo sauce with very few exceptions. So I am sure alot of people dig it, I did not. I tried. I tried and tried but just could not do it. I wish I had known the sauce was so distinct. Had I tried the sauce prior to ordering I would have chosen differently. The presentation was good, and it sure LOOKED great. Again this is just my taste not an issue with the food it self.<br><br>-The bacon mac: A lot of people seem to be less than satisfied with the bacon mac. I thought it was good. I could see how they could have been a lot more creative and looser with the bacon, I mean the truck is called BACON MANIA.. The portion was a bit on the small side as well considering mac n cheese is not a high dollar item. It was what I ate for my $14.00<br><br>-The Coke: Well it was a canned Coca Cola beverage. Pretty standard. It was cold. It was a Coke. <br><br>All and all I have to say I was honestly a bit disappointed. The food trucks in Lincoln once a month is kind of a big deal for our small town. I look forward to it each month and love trying new dishes. This time I felt a little let down is all.

Not the best falafel I have had, but not the worst. Somewhere in the middle. The rice was cooked well, but it was plain and hard to mix in with the rest of the meal.

The sauce was good, but there was SO much hot sauce that it took over the meal and I had a hard time tasting any other flavors. Next time I would leave it off or ask for just a little hot sauce.<br><br>The portion was generous and enough for one person, but I found myself just eating the falafel off the top and throwing away the rice and lettuce.

Slightly Skewed,"Concord, CA",5/29/2014,4,"I didn't expect a 30 minute wait for rice and green beans at the Pleasant Hill Off The Grid event. So I was even more disappointed when my green beans were served warm, but not hot.  The fried rice balls actually weren't hot-out-of-the-fryer hot either. I wasn't in the mood for meat, and all the other trucks seemed like sandwiches and heavy burgers - this was the only light option I saw.  <br><br>The line moves fast and is well-organized.  I don't know that I'd wait 30 minutes again though for food after I order.  I bought a box of water and was happy to see they offered this environmentally friendly product, but then was surprised when we food arrived.  The steamed rice had four (4!!) cardboard/paper boats under it, the green beans had 3, and the fried rice balls also had 2! And they all sat on a cardboard tray.  Why the wastefulness here? <br><br>Friendly service though and the green beans were tasty, even at room (outdoor) temperature. The fried rice was good too, but could definitely have been hotter.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1dQiuUvvK8427TBmqj_4Vg
Slightly Skewed,"Sacramento, CA",10/20/2017,4,"More like 3.75 stars, but yeah, it's a good food truck! The green beans are tasty and I like that they are charbroiled. I only wished they would cut the ends off (for real, when is the culinary world going to come back to reality and realize the ends can be too hard and pointy to eat).   If you get the bulgogi skewers, try to grab some sauce along with it. The bulgogi was charbroiled nicely, but they were difficult to eat off the skewers (alert, it's not going to be elegant to watch); do grab a fork and knife to help you along. Would be nice if they could cut the meat smaller, but I'm full of suggestions, right? I tried the rice balls since everyone was raving about them. The texture is great, being crispy on the outside and not oily in the inside; however, it tasted bland to me. I suggest having a side to eat with it for flavor. Overall, it's a good food truck if you are craving Asian flavors. I recommend it.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=IZ30N98Ik8mHz79u_9ZpjQ

Slightly Skewed,"Sacramento, CA",4/15/2016,4,"There has only been one thing I've tried here that I haven't really enjoyed and that was the grilled Bok Choy. It was overwhelmed with smoky flavor, not really all that pleasant combined with the texture of Bok Choy. <br>Everything else has been fine. The skewers are all really nice, although at the end of the day it is just some meat on a stick, so I'm not going crazy with excitement over them. The flavors are solid though.<br>The burrito is very good and filling and the best part is it comes with smash fries inside (I'll get to those). <br>Spam Musubi, which they have occasionally, is good. Just about what you would expect it to taste like, no more, no less.<br>The fried rice balls have a bit of a strange gooey texture, but the flavor is great and the sauce on top is lovely.<br>Finally, the best part about this truck is the smash fries. They are simply glorious. Super crunchy, great sauces on top and good sized portion for the price. Just remember that they will be quite crispy, but I don't think they have ever been burnt or overdone, it's exactly what they are going for with them, which I think adds a nice texture change to the soft meat sticks (I'm talking about the skewers).",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ynbcf4egd7iF1UnBvHKa9w

How the hell am I supposed to know that?

That's the first thing that come to mind when I think of their Bleu Cheese Fries! These things are like heaven in your mouth. I've ordered them on at least 10 occasions and have never been disappointed.  They are simply the best fries I have ever had. When it comes to the sandwiches it always comes down to the tri tip and the pulled pork. Both are amazing... I tend to lean towards the pulled pork most days but you can't go wrong either way. The artichokes are the bomb and always seem to come back for one after I have finished my meal... very friendly service. 5 stars all day! I recommend to anyone with a taste for delicious food!

I ended up getting the grilled chicken sandwich...let me just say I am very judgmental of grilled chicken sandwiches as I don't eat beef...its what I eat when I get my pseudo burger craving. I always look for a basic but perfectly grilled sandwich with all the right fillings. This was it! Perfect and delicious! The chicken was not too dry or chewy...in fact, it was moist and a perfect piece of breast meat. The sauce was delish and didn't make the bread soggy. Oh...and the bread was amazing! I will definitely be getting more Cichy food in the future. So So So good! Also, for those reviews that complain about the price, I think the prices are competitive when compared to the other food trucks. This is a consumer market and its not really fair to fault a company for staying competitive. I can't wait to try the artichoke.

I ordered the tri tip sandwich and my wife ordered the chicken sandwich, together we shared some onion rings. All three items had their famous aioli sauce but some items had more than others which unfortunately happened to be the main flavor of the items. Without enough aioli sauce some of the items, the chicken sandwich in particular, didn't have as much flavor as some of the sandwiches on other food trucks. Both sandwichs could use some more seasoning/flavor .The food was good but not great like some of the other trucks. Out of the three items we got the best was probably the onion rings because of the amount of tasty aioli sauce they had on them.

With live music, beer garden, and a variety of local food trucks/vendors, you will be sure to have an amazing time! Best of all, it's FREE! <br><br>Some of the amazing food trucks/vendors I've seen this year - Krush Burger, Bacon Mania, Andy's Candy, Rich's Ice Cream, Street Tacos, Joe's BBQ, Gyro 2 Go, and vendors selling kettle corn, kahlua pig sandwiches, pork belly fries, and desserts. <br><br>They have free bike valet, booths from local stations to win prizes, and a lady that makes balloons into animals/shapes for kids. Also, with your CIP wristband, you can attend many after parties in the downtown area. Some bars, clubs, and restaurants will offer happy hour prices on food or free admission. <br><br>Concert in the Park is a great place to have fun, dance to music, eat good food, or just relax on the grass (bring a picnic blanket).

Unfortunately, there was oil all over the gyro to the point I couldn't eat the pita. The oil had also soaked through the container and coated the inside of my insulated bag.

A little different than traditional gyro where the meat is stacked and pressed on a huge skewer and cooked rotisserie style. HEFTY GYROS serves the same meats but cooked more individually instead of large skewer and thats understandable since you never know how many to expect at different locations. <br>I ordered the biggest platter they had. 3 meats were lamb, chicken and beef. ALL were fantastic. Great taste and perfectly cooked. The tasiki sauce was mildly spicy but just right. The crew was friendly and it was cooked pretty fast. <br>The only reason I rated it 4 Stars is because they didnt have any rice. I dont know if they forgot to bring it but it was early in the evening and Im sure they didnt run out yet. The least they could have done is lower the price a buck or two to make up for no rice.

Hefty Gyros,"Mather, CA",3/26/2018,1,"I can't say I was surprised by the food, based on all the many pictures posted of messy, over-dressed ""Greek"" food plates. The food is somewhat flavorful, just not authentic. Their creamy tzatziki sauce is nothing but ranch. I don't even think there's any yogurt or cucumber in it. I ordered a side of falafel and got a chopped up mess over iceberg lettuce, drowned in ranch. They couldn't even keep the falafel intact. The chicken over rice plate was very greasy and also drenched in ranch sauce. Their salad was a disgrace! Definitely not a fresh flavorful Greek style salad, it was chopped iceberg lettuce with, you guessed it, more RANCH! Greek salad is dressed with olive oil, not ranch. In the end I was charged $15 for a plate of chicken over rice &amp; side of falafel, that was probably the equivalent of 1 whole falafel ball chopped into pieces.  But the worse part is that this food truck was shady in that they told me $15, but in reality charged my card $15.50. I was never told there was a charge for using my debit card. Overall I was disappointed by the food and their shady business practices.  If you are craving delicious Greek food, at an affordable price, you're better off going to Falafel Corner, they're in Natomas and also in Folsom.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8JVDSGTZgnDG6EfyONezsQ

We did a little research and with the help of our wedding planner , we went to a food truck event and met with Buckhorn Grill . We were so impressed with the quality and quantity of food. We knew we wanted to book them in that moment. The whole process was so smooth. We didn't have to worry about anything! We had about 100 expected guests so we had booked another food truck too. But, the other food truck did not produce what was agreed upon and basically left us high and dry. When Buckhorn arrived (and early to make sure to be set up ready to go) and heard the other truck bailed, they immediately started prepping faster to make up for it . We are so fortunate for Buckhorn Grill and their professionalism. The guests loved the food and said there was plenty (despite the other truck not being there) . Thank you Buckhorn Grill!!

I really had no idea there was such a thing, but they were happy to give me a sample. Wow. Me: ""SOLD!""<br><br>My sandwich was stacked with turkey pastrami goodness, melted provolone, thousand island and an awesome spicy wasabi mustard. I know I know the wasabi sounds off the wall, but trust me on this it works!

You know the sticks that normally are in a freakin steak! That's how stacked this sandwich was. <br><br>I don't even wanna hear about the price because for $8 bucks I was very happy with the money I spent.

On a Roll,"Orangevale, CA",8/14/2014,4,"I'm new to Food Trucks &amp; am learning fast! Today we had On A Roll roll on into my work place parking lot. I had seen their menu &amp; was excited to have the Turkey Cranberry. When I got tot he truck I noticed their menu was written on white board &amp; their were only about 5 choices. Hmmm, Turkey Cranberry was not on there. I was informed that they don't have all the sandwiches every day. That's ok. To be fair the menu was sent to us by our corporate so it may not have included that disclaimer. Anyway I asked, if they had the ingredients, could they see their way to making it anyway. I really had my heart set on it. No problem they said. Luckily they had the cranberry mustard on hand! So I placed my order along with an order of their corn salad. I'd never had one before so was interested in giving it a go.<br>From order to delivery it was less than 5 minutes.<br>The sandwich was nice sized, not too big, not too small. On par with the size of sandwich size I'd get a the local Raley's deli. The bread roll (white) was soft &amp; slightly dry. Not too dry, but maybe a day or two away from stale. I can hang with that.<br>The turkey was thin sliced(very thin) &amp; seemed like a deli meat &amp; not shredded turkey of the bone, but it did not appear like pressed parts like some store bought deli meat can seem. It was light &amp; not salty. The veggies were light, more meat than greens, with red onion as well. I'm ok with that. The spread was cream cheese, plain &amp; the cranberry mustard. The mustard definitely had a cranberry color &amp; I could taste the berries mixed the mustard, which was a whole seed type, country style. Loved the taste of that! <br>The corn salad had whole kernels of corn mixed with micro-shreds of cheddar cheese &amp; some sort of mayo or cream cheese dressing. It was thick, not thin, with green bells peppers (chopped) &amp; red onion. And corn chips (looked like chili cheese flavored Fritos!). This thing was seriously tasty. I'd make this at home!<br><br>All in all, I had a good hearty sandwich that I pretty much nursed it all afternoon!

Ok, I ordered the quesadilla. I waited for 20 minutes for my quesadilla. I got back to my office, and took off the foil. The portion was huge, so I was really excited. But the food was awful. The flavors did not go well together, it was super oily--more than a regular quesadilla. It seemed like they used Italian dressing or something to try to flavor the chicken. As advertised it said it has salsa in it. That was not salsa. I tried different parts individually to see if anything was salvageable--the chicken was ok, but seemed like it is dark meat or very low quality. The cheeses were not good the tortilla itself was not good because it was soggy from all the grease and, presumably, not being heated enough since they eeee trying to make up for being so slow getting food out. <br><br>Never again.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DS0ev0IjHs7UXdOf0BCWGA

I knew it was pretty much my only opportunity unless I hired them myself and let's be honest, who DOESN'T love pizza?! It looked so fresh and people kept leaving with these awesome looking pies. <br><br>I noticed the pizza crust had a lot of char but I know that comes along with a fire oven pizza and people told me they really enjoyed it despite the char. So I gave it a go! I got the Classic Margherita (Tomato sauce, Mozzarella and Fresh Basil) and I was happy to say my pie crust was great, browned but not charred. Yay!  The pizza overall was okay, I was hoping for more, especially when I saw them brush butter over the crust. The dough, while definitely fresh, just tasted like it could use a little something extra. Actually, all the ingredients were pretty mild in flavor and there just wasn't any signature taste to it. Price on this visit was $8.<br><br>On my next opportunity I got the Garlic Chicken &amp; Spinach (Garlic Crema, Mozzarella, Spinach, Chicken, Onions). This time the price was $9. I had the same experience as before (it was okay) but the crust was pretty charred this time around and I ended having up to leave the burnt pieces behind. Kind of a waste...boo. <br><br>Overall, I like the idea of Paul's Rustic Oven. It's pretty unique to be able to have a fire oven brought to your event with a variety of topping choices.

New Bite,"Sacramento, CA",2/10/2014,3,"The food was tasty enough.

The fries were thick cut with a bit of the skins left on, and not greasy, as another reviewer had mentioned. That being said, these fries are softer and floppier, not crisp as some might expect from their fries. Still tasty, though. The veg were a little overdone... a minute or two less on the grill might be perfect!<br><br>The Tri Tip Sandwich was fresh, but not something I would order again. On their own, all the components of the sandwich tasted fresh and adequately prepared, but together, the sandwich was somewhat underwhelming. The bread was fresh and springy; the BBQ sauce was tangy sweetness with a lil' kick; and the tri tip was certainly not overdone, under seasoned, or improperly trimmed (the top 3 ways--in my opinion--to screw up my tri tip). Regardless, in concert, the sandwich itself was somewhat flat and lifeless. Pass. <br><br>The one thing I have to mention is that the truck takes FOREVER to take your order &amp; prepare it. It took 45 minutes--from my arrival to the truck--to order, receive my order, and walk across the parking lot back to my office (&amp; the parking lot is really not that big).

Came out to 13, got charged 14. Expensive, but not a big issue if the food taste good.  <br><br>I get my food and I go back to the library, I'm about to take a bite but I notice a dark red piece poking out from under the patty, it was a slice of bacon. I do not eat bacon for religious restrictions. No problem, mistakes happen, lets just go back and have them fix it?<br><br>I go back and the cashier(Who i am assuming was the daughter) hears about this, I tell her I am  allergic(easier to explain, and less likely they will mess it up after hearing that). She takes the burger to hand off to the cooks(Mom and Dad possibly). I think at this point, they forgot that their food truck has windows that individuals can see through. What happened next is the reason I am leaving them a 1 star review.<br><br>Reason for the one star review: The cook(the mom) moved her hand towards the burger, pulled something, and the other hand put the bun back on. I do not know why she thought I could not see this. She turned around and gave the burger back and said there is no bacon on the burger. She literally lied to a customer. Granted the girl did not inform the cook that I just told her I was allergic, but that does not justify lying to a customer. <br><br>This is simply an unethical way to run a family business. <br><br>After I told her that I know there was bacon on it, she did not respond and just started to angrily make the burger(as if it was my fault). She shouted out, what was your order? Proceeded to make it. During this time, the other cook(I'm assuming was the dad) was yelling loudly at the Mom about the orders. By the time my new burger was done, the girl was about to call the order out for me to get but noticed there was no fries on the new order. She asks the Mom about the fries, but doesn't get a response. She just hands me the burger, I asked, ""What about the fries?"" The mom just throws the fries in and I get my new food. <br><br>The quality of the food was alright, it was definitely not worth $13.00.<br><br>TLDR: Angus burger doesnt come with bacon, but it had bacon on it. Went back to inform them, The cook took the bacon off and lied to me saying""there was no bacon."" Eventually remade food, didn't include fries(that I paid for) until I pointed it out.

They were flexible when our originally planned setup location was blocked by cars and made it work without even having to consult us. <br><br>One caveat though, we planned with Juanita and she is, understandably, very busy during the summer months! I would start the process very early if you are the kind of person who likes having contracts and everything setup far in advance. We weren't that diligent with checking in with her and only had a verbal sort of agreement, so going into the wedding we weren't exactly sure what was going to happen. But she pulled through above and beyond our expectations, showing up on time and setting up very quickly to get people served right away. The guests loved it and I know my wife and I loved having shave ice between photos out in the 90+ degree heat! She even gave us a special decorated bride and groom shave ice that we took some pictures with (and was delicious!)<br><br>It was the perfect and unique way to share our love of Hawaii with all of our guests here in Cali.

So I have to try their food....well I get ready to order and the slightly skewed staff is already crossing things off the menu because they ran out of menu items, like fries and rice, really you ran out of rice. Oh well, so I have things to try next time. Okay....the beef and chicken skewers were good as was the asparagus but not worth the $8 I had to pay for it. I will say that they took care of their customers. One guy got some free food because they had ran out of other items. Plus they gave discounts because of running out of food. You may or may not care about this but one of the cooks was in the corner munching on skewers, blowing his nose, touching his hair and then back to cooking. No washing or sanitizing of the hands.

On The Fry,"Sacramento, CA",6/10/2018,5,"Pulled pork with shoestring onions over crispy fries that have already been topped with melted cheese. 'Nuff said. Google it. Map it. Follow it. Find it. Because you will not be disappointed. Not only is this delicious but it's ridiculously overloaded.<br><br>Imagine my delight as we drive by Shriners Hospital for Children passing the main UC Davis hospital on our way to my physical therapy session and tucked in between buildings to the left, I spot three food trucks and one Hawaiin shaved ice truck. Physical therapy first, I remind my mind, body and heart. And it just so happens that my session ends at noon--lunchtime.<br><br>Now, seeing a bunch of white coats and scrubs is a bit intimidating. And I'm already ready to put the blame on my mom if my physical therapist shows up. But I think, 'let one of these docs and nurses tell the girl in the wheelchair she isn't allowed to get her food truck fix.' With that in mind, I drive my chair into the grass towards food truck heaven.<br><br>I felt like Goldilocks with the three food trucks in front of me. To the left--some Japanese on-the-grill on-the-go. I'm asian and tired of asian food. The truck to the right--sandwiches. There's a reason why there wasn't a line in front of that truck. Now the middle--On The Fry. And when it comes to fries, my mom's and I can agree on them without hesitation. However, at first glance to On The Fry's menu, I couldn't justify spending $11 on fries. I mean, it's deep-fried cut up potatoes. Our fave is from Mickey D's and is less than $5 at most. But attached to that $11 price tag is pulled pork with shoestring onions. PULLED PORK WITH SHOESTRING ONIONS OVER FRIES. And what delicious pulled pork and shoestring onions they were.<br><br>Don't forget I mentioned that it was overloaded. It even made me think they were underpriced. The pulled pork was tender and sauced evenly. It had the kind of BBQ sauce that made me think it was perfect for the meat. A little sweet with some tang and spices. But there's something about the shoestring onions that made me sad when I ate the last piece. The batter on them were crunchy and seasoned extremely well.<br><br>I'm a creature of habit so I would definitely get the pulled pork fries again. However, I'll have to go with my friends and family so I can convince them to get the buffalo chicken fries that I saw a lot of other folks get as well as their Parmesan garlic fries. Y'know, so I can keep mines &amp; eat theirs ;)<br><br>So my advice, after that overly long description of my experience is to definitely try On The Fry.

But first things first.<br><br>SHORT VERSION:  <br><br>*PROPS TO MOSES &amp; SACTOMOFO<br><br>I have to separate my scrutiny of organizers from my scrutiny of individual vendors. Moses &amp; crew put a lot of hard work into these events by bringing vendors in, rotating them, providing space, and - somewhat unique to Sacto (when compared to L.A.) - manage adjacent parking.  *Props* to them.<br><br>In contrast, vendors set up pricing-points on their own, and long &amp; short of it is, they are gauging Sacramento consumers.<br><br>* 4 Stars for SactoMoFo Organizers<br>* 2 Stars for Vendor-Pricings<br><br>  = 3-Star mean for this review. <br><br>LONG VERSION:  <br><br>*FOOD TRUCK ANTECEDENTS &amp; LOSS OF PURPOSE<br><br>It used to be - and still is when hitting L.A. - Mobile Food Truck options were far less expensive to consumers because it cut-down on ""Brick &amp; Mortar"" restaurant costs, to deliver SAME quality food but at a FAR LESS price.  <br><br>*EXPENSIVE WHEN COMPARED TO SIT-DOWN RESTAURANTS<br><br>Something got lost in shuffle: you shouldn't have to pay thru nose at a food truck, and just to eat your food in an uncomfortable environment. Sure, people expect that at State Fairs, an Arena or an Airport, but it's not an attractive dining option with a ""captive audience."" But people still voluntarily come to this event to be gauged by many vendors &amp; wait in line 30 mins.  <br><br>Further, I don't think ""kitschyness just-to-be-different"" justifies price-gauging.  Oh, sure, many will blow their wad, but most people are still price-conscious about their food costs. Look at menu for Tri-Tip truck:<br><a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sactomofo-sacramento#U333Z9vgdOGjMUkpi4XVyw"">yelp.com/biz_photos/sact…</a><br><br>* $13 for burger or grilled chicken breast combo? Not seeing food truck mission being met to provide quality food at a less expensive price when many outstanding eateries (Burgers &amp; Brews, River City Brewery, Krush, Squeeze, etc.) exist.<br><br>* Pulled trigger on ""Tri-tip loaded fries"" for $10.  <br><a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sactomofo-sacramento#BodrakaNIofZ3v7DwR5gpQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/sact…</a><br>It's not worth $10 - it's MAINLY nachos but with fries instead of chips. I can get comparable loaded fries at Willies here in Sacto for half cost, or at Smoke's Poutinerie in Berkeley a couple times a month &amp; get ""loaded fries"" for $6.99:  <a href=""/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smokespoutinerie.com%2FMenu.aspx&amp;s=240aea056b96f67027ae174bff2b8f962329558bed61e3bd7ef3ad0546ff9dfc"" target=""_blank"" rel=""nofollow"">smokespoutinerie.com/Men…</a><br><br>* Small serving of Paella for $8<br>* Overpriced Ice Cream<br>* Over priced Asian food and Pizza<br><br>When food trucks cost MORE than a brick &amp; mortar, I call that a fundamental problem with the vendor's understanding what a consumer considers reasonable. When I can get my lunch at Chipolte ($7) or Pieology ($8), or a Paesano's &amp; Vallejos lunch ($6-$10 ), the attraction to pay up to 50% or more at a food truck is lost on me.  But it's amazing to watch people act like lemmings to throw $20s at food products not worth the market-cost.  <br><br>MY FRIENDS ARE PART OF PROBLEM<br><br>The ""Emperor has no clothes"" and I looked around for a punch bowl to make sure everyone wasn't drinking the same ""Kool-Aid"". It's amazing how my very friends who bitch about being charged a quarter at Burger King to get a salad dressing condiment (in part because they didn't get a salad) &amp; make pretenses about being ""price-conscious"" about day-to-day mealtime costs, are the SAME PEOPLE who have their brains disengaged from their logic center &amp; buy $10 fries.<br><br>VENDOR RESPECT FOR CONSUMER NOT EVIDENT<br><br>Sure, once in a while I'm all for the ""novelty"", and perhaps that is all SactoMoFo is meant to be.  But vendors still operate daily here in Sacramento, so I have to say when you see consistent gauging, that is NOT consumer respect. Trucks in L.A. are more attuned to market-costs of comparable pricing points to the standard mean one would expect for a ""FOOD TRUCK"" enterprise, thereby still keeping it ""real"".  <br><br>* In L.A., Taco Zone Truck makes the most amazing &amp; ginormous quesadillas and burritos for $6, with a choice of 12 different kinds of meats.  <br><a href=""http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/taco-zone-truck-los-angeles?select=vS0ycQPDf7MTfnqCJnO36w#ShbZP-zXBmGQI-0n-tnfhQ"">yelp.com/biz_photos/taco…</a><br><br>* Korean-Fusion Tacos &amp; Gyros Trucks are still under $5.  Not here in Sacramento or Bay Area.<br><br>THE LOWDOWN<br><br>A fad is a fad, and if it gets to a point it loses touch with actual cost-metrics of doing business, that's when you kill your Golden Goose. And that's the case with no re-calibration in the mobile food truck industry in NorCal.  SactoMoFo as a once-in-awhile ""festival"" can make sense &amp; be fun (albeit the long lines). But if meant to ""showcase"" these same Food Trucks as daily work-lunch options, it's not making the case, unless they have some VERY discernible gimmick going for it.<br><br>BOTTOM LINE: if a food truck item costs more than a comparable item at a restaurant, the truck has lost it's main advantage.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3mNz5nQFTIBQm0oU5mBR0w
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/27/2015,5,"We had a fantabulous time at this year's Mofo. The hubby and I usually hit up the monthly Mofos in our neighborhood, which helped with my strategy for this one. Although I did sample from local trucks, it was all about the Bay Area trucks for me! As soon as I got there, I got in line for Koja Kitchen because I knew it was going to be one of the most popular trucks of the day. I waited in line for about an hour while the hubby walked around and brought me food to sample while I waited. Win win! Koja didn't disappoint...the short rib and the bulgogi sammies were really amazing and the rice 'buns' had nice crispy edges that added just the right texture. The kamikaze fries were SO amazing as well as their take on tiramisu (called mochimisu). I will definitely look for them again next time I'm in the bay. <br><br>Frozen Khusterd, another Bay Area truck, was another favorite of mine. Actually, my whole family loved them. We tried all of their flavors (vanilla bea, thai tea, coffee made with Four Barrel coffee, and cinnamon toast crunch). Luckily, there was no line when my hubby ordered our stuff which was another plus! Aw man...if you've never had frozen custard, you haven't lived. And FK does it RIGHT! I'm still dreaming about that burnt caramel that topped our custard. I'm a HUGE fan now!<br><br>Other items I enjoyed were the empanadas from El Porteno (I tried the mushroom and creme fraiche and the banana and dulce de leche ones and both were good), parm truffle fries from Cichy's (they were ok), rosemary tots from Drewskis, thai tea from Wandering Boba and sammies from the Culinerdy Cruzer. Yes there were crowds upon crowds but everything flowed smoothly and parking wasn't an issue.

A Gyro from the Hefty Gyros truck and I got an order of Jerk Chicken for the road from the folks at the Caribbean Fusion truck.<br><br>I thought the portions vs the cost for the garlic fries were a bit too small but, they are some awesome fries. Crunchy with LOTS of garlic. <br><br>When I ordered my #1 Gyro from the folks at Hefty Gyros, it took less than 2 minutes to get my order. It was fresh, tasty and very portioned between the meat and veggies and the pita bread was fresh and hot when it got to my hands. <br><br>Lastly, after getting home, I opened my Jerk Chicken. It was well seasoned and plentiful. On the side was a fresh mix of cold slaw, fresh papaya and corn salad. <br><br>Overall, this is an awesome event you don't want to miss. No hassles, no hustles and most of all, NO DRAMA.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BBdRlIK_eeFhdl4EL1pLAw
SactoMofo,"Azusa, CA",6/30/2015,4,"I almost didn't go out of pure exhaustion but I'm leaving the area soon and I can't go without attending this at least once. I'm sure glad I did. Beer, live music, and food...all the food!<br><br>Parking:<br>Came at around 7pm so parking in the main lot was gone (free parking if you donate a can of food) and most of the streets were filled but we managed to get a spot about two blocks away on a small side street. <br><br>Lines:<br>Honestly not too bad. Koja kitchen had the longest line out of the 6 places we went to but it actually moved really fast. The ones we went to are: Koja Kitchen, Chairman Bao, Addy's Paella, An the Go, Sweet Spot, &amp; Frozen Kuhsterd. <br><br>Food:<br>Food ranged from average to amazing. Best part of the whole experience is getting a bit of everything to test it out. I suggest sharing with a friend.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",5/18/2015,4,"Where do I begin? Ah yes, the SactoMoFo of course! This is the first time coming here for the Sacramento's yearly food truck festival event, and yes, it's totally jammed pack! There are nearly 40(?) food trucks available from local to Bay Area (mostly known for the finest burger fusion, the Koja Kitchen) that everyone will try to eat whether they are trying something new, or visiting your favorite food trucks that everyone likes the most.<br><br>I got there for that event before the festival began as I entered the parking lot earlier at 1 PM. The parking cost $5 to get in, but however, you can bring your canned foods or dry foods to donate for a free parking! It's a win-win for me because it's a great idea to donate foods to the Sacramento Food Bank. A great, awesome cause to fight human hunger.<br><br>Now onto the event, I started to get Drewski's before the ordering process begun. As the event started, I got my order getting a famous Hemi sandwich with tots. Additionally, I also order two tacos from the Chando's Tacos food truck too! Now onto the crazed side, these famous food trucks are lined up very long due to the these selected food trucks that it's rarely appear in Sacramento like Koja Kitchen, Wandering Boba, Rudy's Hideaway, etc. I haven't tried their foods despite the long line, but I'll decide to come back if these Bay Area food trucks or similar restaurant might be appear soon in that area or by travel.<br><br>The customers are well received for all selections of food trucks. No bad issues at all. The security is also excellent too including the parking management.<br><br>In the end, SactoMoFo is the greatest Sacramento food truck festival that I've ever visited. I'll come back for next year if these well-known food trucks might return.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3HSmHE-FQZ7b2kyfa1e64A

SactoMofo,"Elk Grove, CA",4/26/2015,3,"3.49 stars...<br>This food truck festival is held in Sacramento yearly around the last weekend in April.  This so far is the eighth one in the books.  It's huge as there are close to thirty food trucks all lined up ready to serve you.<br><br>Being from Sacramento and having been caught up in the food truck craze for quite some time now, I mainly have my faves when the SactoMofo festival is held underneath the freeway; same site as the Sunday Farmers market.   I obviously hang around Koja Kitchen, An the Go and El Porteno.  Koja Kitchen for their shortrib koja, An the Go for their garlic noodles and El Porteno for their Alfajores (shortbread-like cookie sandwiched with caramel creme filling) ~ this is the reason for the craze!!!  All three of these trucks are from the Bay Area and very hard to get too all at one time!!!<br><br>I figure I can frequent the other Sactown food trucks at the local level that it's a must go to when the Bay Area food trucks do make it to our town. Chairman food truck was also here today and had a line a mile long as well.  They are also a fan favorite and their prices are reasonable.  I did see that even Frozen Kuhsterd made an appearance from the Bay Area too but it was a bit cooler than usual as we had rain earlier in the day and some people may not be up to having ice cream or are lactose intolerant as my hubby is.<br><br>I always suggest to people to get here early.  Or if you go with another friend/couple ask them to order what you want as well bc it's so hard to be in line forever especially if you have children or with someone who needs to eat right away. Today was no exception.  It seemed like the lines were even longer than usual.  I would suggest to SactoMofo that they would hold these events with the Bay Area trucks more than just once a year.  It just gets too crazy that people don't want to come or just give up on lines.  This year too the times were starting at 2 PM until 9 PM.  Why not 12 PM to 7 PM??? Well, I'm not in charge but I can merely suggest as I've been to plenty of these in the past.  Plus I don't usually stay as I am not a fan favorite of what music is played here neither.  I did notice that seating seem sparse as the lines were so big that they needed space for the lines and that's the reason for less tables in the middle that they even had tables in the far corner closer to Southside Park.<br><br>I do praise SactoMoFo for holding these events but there is a reason for the madness and maybe you can see that having more than just one annual one will make more sense!!!  Kudos to you Paul from SactoMoFo and hope that you take these suggestions to heart.  It's not about making money but it's bringing what people want here in Sactown and that's Bay Area Food Trucks!!! Don't worry I will frequent the next one...wow next April 2016!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pjxgZ_tjfP4xibXL3jofPg

Yes, I do believe hell has frozen over :)<br><br>Offering their wares were Krush Burger, Drewski's, Gameday Grill, Chando's, Local Kine Shaved Ice, Simply Southern Food, Knucklehead Dogs, and Dave&amp;Luke's Pops. Total score! I honed in on Knucklehead and Simply Southern because I hadn't tried either one before. From Knucklehead, I got the Pig Pen ($7), a beef dog wrapped in bacon then deep fried and smothered in chili, cheese, and onions...super!! I then meandered over to Simply Southern to try their much-vaunted corn cake ($4), but also got an order of ther mac &amp; cheese ($4), and let me tell you they were BOTH amazing. <br><br>If I hadn't already had Local Kine earlier in the day when they were at PERS, I would've had one of their great shave ices, So, I went over to Dave&amp;Luke's Pops and tried their Pina Colada pop, which was delicious and refreshing and only 100 calories.

The container was so heavy I almost dropped it!  The food itself was satisfying and authentic. TBH it's been awhile since I worked on a cruise ship sailing to Ocho Rios and I don't remember what I ate there so I can't definitively vouch for the food's authenticity.  But when food is good though, no complaints here!  The plantains had just the right amount of sweetness.  Coconut curry chicken had the perfect spice and wasn't too saucy.  We literally tore through that jerk chicken.  And the coconut rice had a hint of coconut taste without being overwhelming.<br><br>They so use Square so credit card payments are welcome.  I shared the meal with a hefty eater and we both were full (disclaimer: I did have a carbonated beverage with the meal, though).  Anytime I can feed myself and another person for $20 or under, I consider it a win!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=-aq0KKWyMbhugu183UGj7Q

Bacon MANia Truck,"Rancho Cordova, CA",8/12/2014,1,"OK, so after a whole lot of build up, I was able to make it to an event featuring bacon mania... And I have to say I was very,very disappointed. I am a chef and I love bacon, so what could be better than an entire truck dedicated to it? Well, let's begin at the beginning... The pricing is more than a little on the high side... I paid 7 bucks for a tiny portion of bacon Mac and cheese. But hey, bacon is expensive nowadays, so I paid it. Or at least it was supposed to be bacon Mac and cheese.. It only had a few bacon bits sprinkled on top. The sauce was congealed and grainy. It really wasn't a sauce at all. Just clumps of grainy funk stuck together. I kept looking for bacon inside of it but there wasn't any! The flavor was OK, and the noodles weren't too overcooked, but it was borderline. Come on guys, bacon is your signature ingredient for Pete's sake!!<br>Then I got the pulled pork sliders. I have to say they were way better than the baconless Mac. For 9 bucks the portion was meager. Once again the menu boasted of bacon. I promise you there was absolutely none on either slider! We disassembled them to be certain. The pork was tender, and juicy. It was the star of the show. The coleslaw topper was fresh and good.  I also like the roll. But without the bacon it was supposed to have it was just an overpriced pulled pork. The sauce was thin, almost watered down. <br><br>To sum up, it is my opinion that if you are supposed to do one thing, do it well. If you are the bacon truck put bacon on the dishes that are supposed to have bacon. Rehydrate your sauces before they are ruined. But most of all, get your guys on the truck to do some quality control prior to sending food out.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O13oP0ttmGJQ69jCFogJ2g

The flavors are definitely there and... man oh man, it's STILL burning and my nose is STILL running and I haven't even finished the 2nd one yet!

Local Kine Shave Ice,"Sacramento, CA",9/5/2015,4,"So before I go into this review, I should preface it by saying I'm comparing these guys to a well known place in Maui which I just had for the first time last week. Prior to that I've never had shaved ice and it never sounded too impressive to me. The shaved ice I had in Maui was so awesome though, I went there 4 times in one week! I thought I would try these guys at SactoMofo since I was craving more. For Sacramento, they are good but unfortunately they're not quite as good as the real thing in Maui. I ordered the mango, coconut, guava with macadamia nut ice cream and snow cap. Portion size was very good and price was very good. Flavor was decent. Here's some of the differences I noticed between Kine ice and Maui one. Kine ice isn't quite as fine. It's actually slightly icy hard in some spots which I didn't care for. The Maui one was super fluffy and was never hard. Temp difference between Sac and Maui might have a little bit to do with that.  They also don't pack it down as well with their hands like the one in Maui does. The ice in Maui was packed super smooth and the bottom edge where it meets the cup was cleaned with chopsticks to get rid of any ice bits. When using my spoon on the Kine ice, bits and small chunks of hard flaked ice fell off and landed in my lap. Syrup flavors were also not as intense with the Kine and some tasted artificial. Overall it was good but not sure if I'll go back until it gets hot again and I'll give it a second try.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6cCNoj8owfex3cLaIIC66Q

I follow them on Twitter and make it a point to visit this truck when they are in town. The ice is shaved super fine, the syrups are homemade and delicious, the toppings are something special and completely authentic, and the staff is very friendly. If you miss Hawaii, check them out. If you have never had authentic Hawaiian shave ice, do yourself a favor and give it a try.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bosiecuFDaA5mUzD0E_aew

Squeeze Burger,"Vallejo, CA",10/28/2018,5,"What can I say about Squeeze Burger that hasn't already been said, I wonder? There are really only two words that one needs to hear to instantly know exactly what this place is all about: CHEESE SKIRT.<br><br>If you're perplexed, take comfort in the fact that you are not alone. I had never heard of such a thing. I guess the idea is that while the burger is cooking, a large piece of cheese is applied that is far wider than the burger itself, so that the cheese ends up spilling onto the grill and frying all on its own. Strange concept that was no doubt the result of error, but friends, what a result it was.<br><br>What you are left with is fried cheese that has the same general firmness of a somewhat-soggy plate of nachos. Which happens to be exactly what you are hoping for if you happened to order your burger with jalapenos. Which I would highly recommend, as it certainly adds another layer of fascination to what is already a pretty unique experience.<br><br>The burger itself is soooo juicy and delicious, and the buns seemingly melt in your mouth. The fries aren't anything special, but that is fine, considering they are obviously comfortable in their supporting role. There are also some pretty tasty beers on tap, such as the Space Dust, which is a must-have for any potential lunch spot near me.<br><br>Prices are fair, and service was super friendly and fast. Do yourself a favor and check out the cheese skirt. I know, I know, a Guy Fieri endorsement is typically a kiss of death for me, too. But sometimes he gets it right. And this place is definitely in the business of getting it right.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cVsImU1ADzzBDQlKDidNPg

You well need to figure out what you are going to do with the ball of deliciousness, called a cheese skirt. I just folded it up onto the burger. The cheese set the burger off. However, caution, the burger puts off a lot of grease and it will run down your arm. The service at this place was excellant. My server was very attentive and was on top of all my needs. Please note that they only allow carry out orders after 30 minutes before closing, so you need to plan ahead.<br><br>They also have a tv over their bar area.  The Celtics/Cavs game was on while I was there so that was a plus.

Service was not that great either. We all got waters in these small plastic cups which was drunk quickly and we only got refilled once.

Squeeze Burger,"Middletown, RI",6/28/2018,2,"Where to begin?... well, a place with such good reviews and a place that claims it has ""the best burger in town"" should have raised at least a couple red flags. I really wanted to like this place as I was in the mood for a good burger. I ordered take out which is all I wanted anyway, double burger with ""cheese skirt"" and fries. Fries were obviously soggy as crap by the time I got to it which was expected, but as I pulled the burger out of he bag my inner (and outer these days) fat boy said ""daaaaaamn!"". <br><br>This horrific burger was like 3lbs and wrapped in so much greasy paper I thought I'd never peel all of the paper off! The minute I saw this cheese skirt I didn't know what to think. I mean I love cheese but a giant burnt pancake of cheese shoved on top of a burger? Come on, no way that works. Took a bite of the mammoth, yep tastes like burnt cheese, under seasoned meat, horrifically soggy bun due to the 3 shot glasses of grease I could have filled from this burgers runoffs. Absolutely horrible burger. <br><br>The only thing giving this an extra star was the friendly staff. However, I did notice an up charge cause it didn't seem like a burger fries and soda should ever cost $20 at a place like this. In fact, the guy who ordered after me (who'd been there for years) was concerned about the price of his meal too. Nothing on the menu seemed to reflect why this disgustingly greasy and bland abortion of a burger would ever cost that much... ugh, why the hell isnt there an In-N-Out Burger downtown?!?",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=20DW_6j_qqFqK40FHRIsTg

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",9/29/2015,4,"Oh SactoMoFo, so many weekly roundups I just keep coming back! My first time was at the downtown Woodland events (Sundays), and I've also been to the Morse Park/Elk Grove (Saturdays) and West Sac (Wednesdays) one. However, this North Natomas Library event is literally near and dear to me, right in my own backyard! I remember driving down Del Paso seeing the trucks before and wondering what was going on...then one evening (thank goodness the library is open until 8pm on Thursdays!) I had business at the library and happened upon SactoMoFo -- I took it as a sign from the Universe. I think my first purchase at N. Natomas SactoMofo was from Have You Found The Sweet Spot? -- a cookie/ice cream sandwich with none other than Gunthers' ice cream. Since then I frequent Happy Cow Ice Cream (waffle cones), Wandering Boba (sisig), Krush Burger (cowbell slider), Hefty Gyro (falafel and fries), etc. Some other trucks that are there a lot are the Local Kine shave ice, Gameday Grill, Squeeze Inn (cheeseburgers), Baconmania, La Mex Taqueria, Kettle Corn. In general, I'm also a fan of Drewski's, Luciano's Scoop, Chando's, Cecil's and Culinerdy Cruzer. Sometimes there are even bonus SactoMoFo events if there are extra ""days"" in the month. Parking isn't bad for the library, don't go into the ARC Extension lot though, that requires payment/permit. Street parking on Via Ingoglia is accepted too.

SactoMofo,"Concord, CA",4/25/2015,4,"I'm becoming an extremely big fan of food trucks. <br><br>Tahoe park is the perfect place to have something like this. It was convenient for my girlfriend and I because her mom lives literally a block away. The park is huge, so there is plenty of room for the trucks, for people to sit. They had a few tall tables set up for people to stand and eat, but for the majority of people it looked like they just brought lawn chairs to sit in. Including us. <br><br>We wasted no time. As soon as the chairs were set up, we went on the hunt for our food. Cruising down the line of food trucks, I took peak interest in Gameday Grill. I first saw a sample of their stuff when a guy walked by with a giant plate of fries with pretty much everything in the known universe on it. When he told me it came from Gameplay Grill I knew I had to check them out. The menu has burgers, sandwiches, a hot dog and the fries. They have different styles on another board with descriptions of each style. Then under each item, it shows what style it comes in. Though a burger or sandwich sounded very tempting, I was set on those fries. It comes with either tri-tip or chicken. The list of things on the dish is as follows: Fries, tri-tip, sour cream, jalapenos, bacon and cheese sauce. Seriously it was so good, some of the best cheesy fries I've ever tasted. <br><br>I was also able to try a few of the ribs from Smokers Wild. Girlfriend ordered them and not only were they gigantic and drenched in barbecue sauce but they were fall of the bone tender. Literally you can pull the meet straight off with ease. I'm not a huge fan of ribs, but these were so good I couldn't stop eating them. <br><br>A friend who lives in Sacramento said ""You can't live in Sacramento without trying Chando's tacos."" I don't live in Sacramento anymore, but with a testament like that, this place has to be good. I ordered two asada tacos for 4 dollars. Not a bad deal at all. The tacos were done as soon as I was done ordering. Partly because the kid taking my card was having a hard time. Simple delicious tacos. Asada, with cilantro and a mildly spicy green salsa. Oh and a few radish slices. Just phenomenal. I scarfed them both down, in a matter of seconds and joked about heading back to get more. Which I probably would of done if I was alone. Nothing is better then finishing a taco, and then having enough of the salsa on your hands, and the filing in the tray to make another one, and you just eat it like that. <br><br>We had Luciano's scoop, which is a gelato truck. A few interesting flavors, but the one that called out was Apple Pie. You have the incredible creamyness of the gelato, and add the cinnamon, apple flavor plus some pie crust in the middle, and you just made the gelato of the heavens. <br><br>The last stop was Costa's Kettle Corn. 15 flavors to choose from, plus fresh squeezed lemonade and strawberry lemonade. I wanted to try the bacon chedder flavor, but instead got the bacon cheddar and caramel. Though it didn't sound good at first, I was shocked by how good it tasted. We also got a bag of caramel apple, which is good, but nothing compared to the other. <br><br>Live music from Jimmy Ashley who played everything from 90's rock to country. Taking requests, and thanking people for tipping even in the middle of the song. It really added to the vibe of the whole thing, and you could tell because between bites, everyone was singing along. <br><br>There were a few trucks that didn't make it sadly. But the ones that were there really knocked it out of the park.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UuAk4jHFBCHlgiAFJfubQw

This isn't the first Sacto Mofo event we have attended, but it is the first one we have attended in our little city. Unlike the other events we have attended this one did not have live music, but to be fair it was a rather small event. I didn't count the trucks, but I think there were somewhere around 10 trucks in attendance. I think that is a fair amount to satisfy most any palate. <br>For once my little family (3 of us, me, the hubbs and our 13yr old) all agreed on the same truck for our dinner. We had amazing sandwiches from Drewski's. We all chose the Mustang. A wonderful Korean flavor grilled cheese with Korean meat and kimchi. We also shared some super duper garlic-y tots. Yummz!<br>Other trucks we considered were Bacon Mania, Krush (always amazing) and Rudy's Cruzin Crustacean. Others in attendance were Chandos, Volkswaffle and a few others I missed the names of.<br>There was ample seating for enjoying your food and we had no problem securing a spot for the 3 of us. I like events like this with community tables because it gives you a chance to meet nice people. We sat across from a friendly elderly man that we visited with during our meal.

SactoMofo,"Woodland, CA",3/21/2014,4,"I'm guilty of following the food truck craze - and keeping up with their location Twitter feeds and driving around like a mad woman to find them is getting old.  I am thrilled that SactoMofo holds these events to bring local and bay area food trucks together in one location.  I attended Trucktoberfest, which was held at Riverwalk Park in West Sacramento.    <br><br>I didn't want to spend $7 on parking (that's a meal after all) so after circling the surrounding streets for 20 minutes, I eventually found street parking.  The set up had the trucks parked on two levels.  It was frustrating to walk around the trucks on the upper levels because there wasn't enough room on the pathway.  Majority of the trucks were located on the lower level which had a live band stage, jump houses, a face painting station and the beer garden.  Since there were no tables or a seating area, we opted to sit in the shaded grass area next to the river.  I noticed many people brought folding chairs probably anticipating there would be limited seating.  Mental note for next time.  <br>        <br>I ordered from the following trucks: <br><br>Chairman Bao - I am a big fan of Chairman Bao, so I make it a point to check them out when they are in the area.  We ordered two types of steamed buns - Crispy Garlic Tofu with miso greens and the Cola braised pork with Savoy Cabbage.  The tofu was crispy on the outside!  My only qualm is that the dish was unusually dry and could have used a little sauce.  The cola braised pork was savory and filling.  Each bun was $3.75.  <br>  <br>Koja Kitchen - I just had to try their famous Korean BBQ Short rib Koja - a Korean sandwich held together with by a fried rice-ish bun.  The sandwich looked pretty and impressive, but it was a hot mess to eat as it fell apart immediately with the first bite.  The sandwich had a generous amount of short rib which was savory, juicy and authentic.  The Kamikaze fries are my favorite!  Crisscut fries topped with Korean BBQ Beef, green onions and sweet and spicy sauces - yum!  <br><br>Iced tea stand - This was the best drink deal at the event.  I got a large Iced tea (can also get lemonade) for $4 AND it included a free drink refill. <br><br>Keep in mind that attending these events will test your patience.  You will deal with limited parking, unpredictable weather and ridiculously long lines.  That being said, the experience of trying unique dishes is sometimes worth the wait.   Excited for the next SactoMofo event!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=La3CyFm6DPAc54n7FrUJSQ
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",10/25/2013,4,"The first of what is hopefully many Sactomofo events was a huge success, which worked for and against it's favor. The goal was to raise awareness of the archaic laws that limit the times and locations where food trucks can serve in Sacramento. Awareness was indeed raised, but so much so that there were mammoth lines that didn't many to even sample the food. It's hard to blame the event organizers for such chaos. No bellwether previously existed with which to gage the popularity of these mobile eateries. <br><br>My fellow yelpers and I took a strategic approach. We broke up into pairs and singles and tackled 5 or 6 lines simultaneously. After hours standing in the sun (I can't complain, really. It was a beautiful day.), we forged our way to the front of each line and purchased our meals. We then assembled on the grass with the food displayed in the middle for all to eat. I don't know if the portions were all larger than we expected or our eyes were just too big for our stomachs, but we had way more food than we could handle. I think the group favorites were the fried macaroni and cheese from Drewski's and Chando's tacos. <br><br>I'm proud of Yelp for sponsoring such a prestigious event. I hope this was just the kind of boost these trucks needed so they will no longer conduct business in the shadows!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o5STsEtfvD1Ig0J7Z-1uxA
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",5/4/2011,5,"Where are all my fellow yelpers!  This was a fun event and considering this wasn't a money making event (proceeds went to charity) it was well put together.  Johnna was manning the Yelp Wheel of Swag along with a couple of other volunteers.  Parking was $3 or free with a canned food donation and vehicle entrance and exits were being monitored to prevent traffic jams since this location is under the freeway and not in true event center.  We arrived a few minutes before 11am and there were 1/2 hour long lines at Koja Kitchen, The Chairman and Krush.  There were10 minute lines at Roli Roti, Green Papaya and few other trucks.  Most of the other trucks had no wait or a 5 minute or so long wait.  There was a nice picnic area set up in front of the live music area with tables, chairs and garbage cans---perfect!  The beautiful weather outside made this the perfect walk around and stuff your face event. <br><br>We ended up sampling goods from Roli Roti, Koja Kitchen, We Sushi, Krush and a Dawg stand (cant recall the name).  All the food was fresh hot and delicious.  We will be looking forward to this events return next year!<br><br>My only real complaint would be the Reggae band playing was just a wee bit to loud as it was impossible to hear what the person next to you was saying.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=qZ3sJPn5NqSVFMLYGAJH_A
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/27/2013,5,"Ok...so let me first start by saying I wish people leaving reviews would know what the %$#@ they are even reviewing before they leave poor reviews and potentially damage the livelihood of someones business. SactoMoFo is NOT a food truck! Nor does it have control of the quality of the food coming out of a truck or the quality of the taste buds in your potentially damaged palat or brain for that matter. What they are is a very well oiled machine in the event operating and planning business.<br>    With that said I recently visited a weekly neighborhood gathering of about ten trucks and I must say wow! I am normally the critical guy looking to find what they could do better but I found nothing. The trucks were all beautifully lined up at the curb. It was in a spot with tons of convenient parking. They had tons of very clean large picnic tables and chairs as well as many standing tables (my preffered). Plenty of trash cans and multiple recycling bins. Hand sanitizing stands. A hand wash center with a generator for warm water. As well as an awesome sound system with great music!  They also had people constantly and quietly roving around quickly keeping the place spotless all with a smile. Oh, and did I mention it was right next to a lovely playground and huge lawn area so you could let the kids burn of some energy while you enjoy your meal? I just could not be more impressed with how it was all handled. I went back again the next week and was just as much in awe. Not to mention surprised at the fact that they rotate trucks so you have a whole new set of choices from week to week. SactoMoFo is great and doing a wonderful service and bringing communities together with amazing food and friendly atmosphere. This joyful weekly event is just the out of town feeling with my family I need to help me recharge my batteries with the feel of a vacation from lifes day to day stress. I love it and can't wait until next week! Thank you SactoMoFo for giving me a little peace.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=E2PEMtaq6k_IAxrPIcZDng
SactoMofo,"Woodland, CA",3/12/2015,4,"My rating is actually more of a 3.5 stars.<br><br>I really like this event because for people like me, who really don't want to go hunting down food trucks, it anchors them to one place.<br><br>I really dont like this event because since they are anchored into place, everybody and they mama are gonna be there.<br><br>This is great way to sample what food trucks have to offer, which in many cases is way better than some regular brick and mortar spots.  Also the event brings in trucks that normally do not serve this area, like The Chairman Truck and Hapa SF from San Francisco.  So I always make a point to visit these trucks.  They even have some other local vendors that aren't exactly ""food trucks"".  They have some mobile catering businesses and other little food stands there.<br><br>The lines are ridiculous!  There are a lot of people that come to the event and they pretty much want to try a little from every truck so all the lines a long.  So choosing a spot to eat is going to have to be a commitment.  You have to be sure that you really, i mean really want to buy food from that truck.<br><br>OK now here is a couple tips to make this event more enjoyable. This of course, coming from my personal experience.<br><br>1.  Bring your Patience.  Your gonna need it for the long lines and the time its gonna take to park.<br>2.  Bring a friend.  The more the better.  Have everyone stand in different lines so that you can maximize the time you are spent just waiting.  <br>3.  Bring your appetite.  There are a lot of places to eat and you want to try them all.  Chances are tho you are gonna work up the hunger waiting in line and watching people walking around with different food..<br>4.  Bring cash.  its faster than card and it'll keep the lines moving<br>5.  Bring your PATIENCE.  you really are gonna need it.  Hella people mean LONG lines and NO parking<br><br>Overall its a great event.  I still go to it regardless of its faults.  It really is a great way to experience food that otherwise is hard to find except for the lucky and the more savvy foodie can stumble upon.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Dc9iHJv1IN3hXTPllxwLSw

I feel that the food trucks should change it up a little, like at the UCDMC weekly Thursday, there usually new trucks that comes. Maybe its because its a bigger crowd that show up. There usually the same trucks at Lowes. <br>We usually end up ordering from Chando truck or Krush burger or just going home empty handed. We usually order from Chandos their carne asada, pastor, pork tacos and burrito. Mini burgers from Krush burger and of course their sweet potato tots with their sauce. <br>We had Drewskis a few times, its good, but its not always what I want to eat.

SactoMofo,"Fairfield, CA",9/7/2015,4,Great family event. I was surprised they had a screen and were showing a kids movie.  Would have been nice to have more vendor booths.  First time I have attended one of their events.  Went to the Vallejo event.  There were a lot of people there.  Lines were really long at the trucks that seemed to have everyones favorites. Kado's Asian Grill was our favorite.  They gave us a taste before we ordered.  Sacramento's Ortgtnal Taco Truck had the worst tacos and burritos we had ever had.  Rice was dry and everything had no flavor. The salsa was great but it didn't help.  The scheduled band flaked so they had a replacement singer.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",5/2/2015,4,"Sacto MoFo 4:  definitely a better experience than the first one.  Parking was easier, even though the designated lot was full.  Found free street parking a short 2 blocks away.  The freeway above provided much needed shade for standing in line.  They set up tons of tables/chairs so you could actually sit and enjoy your food, while listening to the live bands.  Whole Foods provided free dried fruit and nuts at each table.  Also saw a small beer garden.  There were a lot people, and I did see long lines, but the longest that I waited for food was about 30 minutes.  Sure beats the 3 hour wait at the first MoFo!  The shorter wait times and more variety of vendors participating allowed me to try several different food trucks.  <br><br>Addy's Paella:  The rice wasn't fully cooked, it was a bit oily, but the overall flavor was delicious.  The shrimp, chicken, and sausage were all good.  They squirted on, what I assumed, was some sort of tasty thick aioli sauce, which the paella definitely didn't need.<br><br>El Porteno Empanadas Argentinas:  They offered 3 different fillings.  Good thing I wanted to try the mushroom one because they were sold out of the others by the time I got around to this booth.  It was more of a flaky buttery pastry bread filled with really yummy shrooms and cheese.  To die for.<br><br>La Costanera Contemporary Peruvian Cuisine:  I had the pork sandwich and plantains.  The sandwich was a little dry.  I know it came with a sauce, but there wasn't enough.  They were generous with the pork which had great flavor, but just a bit overcooked (dry).  The plantains were  lightly sweetened with honey and cinnamon(?), and also served in a generous portion.<br><br>The Chairman Bao:  The best thing I ate all day!  They actually ran out of the ""baked"" baos, which sounded like banh mi sandwiches, so I had the ""steamed"" bao, equivalent to a Vietnamese bao street taco.  I tried the pork belly and the spicy chicken.  They were so yummy!  Packed with all kinds of great spicy, sweet, savory Asian flavors.  The Chairman better watch out...I'll be stalking the streets of S.

They kept forgetting to hand out ticket numbers at the window and then would alternate between calling out orders by number and then by dish so everyone waiting didn't know what was going on. <br><br>The whole process was extremely disorganized and people waiting for orders were laughing at how bad things were.

The bun was soft, slightly chewy. The veggies were fresh &amp; the beef was seasoned just right. I know some had complained about them being too salty. I did not find that to be the case.

Due to some delays I wasn't able to eat my fries for about a 1/2 hour after I bought them.

New Bite,"Sacramento, CA",12/26/2013,1,"My husband and I were excited to try New Bite at Track 7 tonight as we've had great experiences with the other food trucks in their parking lot but that excitement turned into a whole bunch of disappointment. To start with the service was awful, I don't know if the girl at the counter was the owners daughter but she had no idea what she was doing.  My husband had to repeat his order at least five times;  it was only two sandwiches and an order of fries.  Keep in mind, the menu had max 12 items on it.  I left half way thru, got in line for beer and my husband didn't join me for another five minutes.  We got a table, sat down and began the hour wait for our food.  We were joined at our table by a family and began talking about what number our order was. They had number six, we were number one 30 minutes earlier they were calling 91.  As time went on one of the ladies sitting with us went up to check on her order and brought back my sandwich; which really wasn't my sandwich.  The person in the truck told her this was for order one, but it was sliders not a regular burger.  Whatever, I've  been waiting close to an hour, I took it.  We were still missing my husbands tri-tip sandwich and our fries.  10 minutes later we got the fries and 10 minutes later we got his sandwich.  Meanwhile the nice ladies next to us got half of their order. As far as the food, it may have been the fact that I was so irritated about waiting that it didn't taste good but really the sliders were over-cooked and super salty, the fries were mediocre and my husband only ate half his sandwich.  The whole experience was seriously awful, I would not recommend New Bite to anyone.  They really need to get a plan and work on their customer service.  I know owning your own business is difficult but without a good reputation you're never gonna make any money.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=8um-Q5i4ED5UrXsqAtBZKQ

So he took them from me and he literally removed the bacon in 2 seconds and told me ""I made you a new one"" oh really? You could still see the pieces of bacon. Another thing I asked for extra paradise, they only charged but they didn't added it. I was annoyed. My coworker got the fries and burger .

They were the only food truck at the farmers market from what i observed. While i was walking up to the food truck i can smell the delicious indian herbs and spices from far away. <br><br>I wanted to try the chicken tikka masala. The sauce and chicken looked very good. The sauce was not runny or too thick. The sauce was just perfect where i like the texture of the sauce. i requested the sauce to be spicy hot. The cook made the sauce from mild to medium hot due to my request. First few taste of the sauce it was mild then it gets spicier at the end. The texture of the chicken was the bone fall off and the chicken wasnt the texture i was looking for. The chicken seemed like it was already pre cooked and warmed up. The chicken was a bit too well done for me.  I like my chicken just cooked right to the point where its just finish freshly made. i like the chicken to be juicy and tender and still have the chicken texture too where its not over cooked. <br><br>The vegeterian samosa was good. I ordered 2 and it was 6 bucks. The samosa were big. Lets start with the outside of the samosa the texture of it was on the harder side. The crust reminded me of a pie crust, it was def on the crunchy side. I tried stabbing it with a plastic fork and it wasnt sucessful. I then gave up and used my hands before it got cold. Now onto the inside where it was steaming hot and inside was filled with curry potatoes and pea and carrot and corn and i really like the filling. It was very tasty and filled with spice inside because while i was eating i seen some pieces of spice in it. i used the mint chintzy which is a bit sweet and sour and spicy and the mint chutney was so good and refreshing but more on the sweet side. the red sauce which came with the samosa was good too but it didn't stand out like the mint chutney sauce did. i also used the left over of my masala sauce to dip the samosa and it the bomb in other words amaze balls! <br><br>overall it was a great experience and nice owners and chef for the food truck and i am planning to come back and try some more of the food. something that caught my eye was lamb bryani rice.

There weren't many tables to eat at so I suggest to go across the street for a nice little picnic at the park. <br><br>My favorite truck: Koja Kitchen. This truck had the longest line but it was well worth the wait! <br><br>There was a great variety of local Sacramento food trucks along with some from the Bay Area. <br><br>Overall my tummy was satisfied From all the yummy goodness. Great event!,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Hvu1tpiG2kTtTeY40jkT8w
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",12/3/2011,4,"A review of organization/event:<br>Pretty cool set-up. Great location with lots of parking and ample space for the lines. The tables and chairs were needed and very welcome. The music was a nice touch and the toy drive was very cool. I could see how they incorporated feedback from prior events, so props and an extra star for that.<br>Not so sure about some of the other promotions, like massage and XOSO. Also wasn't so keen on the non-truck places, they felt more like a farmer's market or other event caterers, rather than something we'd see out on the street in town. There could have been a big sign with the map of who was where, as well as what was local vs. from out of the area.<br><br>As for the food/trucks themselves, what a disappointment. I really enjoyed the mobile foods when I lived in LA, they have really made it an art. I wasn't impressed with the menus and especially the prices at this event. I don't have too much experience with Sac-based trucks, but this wasn't a good introduction. Over-reliance on frying stuff, hot dogs, emphasis on meat generally and pork specifically was a major turn-off for me. I don't do cheese or much meat, so my options were quite limited (although I did see some vegan options, none really sang to me).<br><br>The lines were more than my level of tolerance for food. I showed up at 11:20, so there really shouldn't have been such insane lines already. I wanted to try some lumpia, but wasn't about to wait around all day for it. <br><br>Everything was too pricey, especially for the lack of overhead. Maybe LA trucks do more volume and can keep it down, but this is Sac. C'mon, $4 for a ten ounce smoothie?<br>The worst was watching the bacon truck cross off their sides, after crossing off three of the five entrees, at 11:25AM!!! How bad can you be as a business owner to run out of food that quickly? I mean, why even show up?<br><br>All in all, I'll probably pass on the next one.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pjoHox87L5GlsDut315C1Q
SactoMofo,"Mountain View, CA",4/27/2013,3,"Okay this is definitely an averaged star review based on different things done well and done horribly at this event.<br><br>First, the location. I actually think it's ingenious that they put the food trucks UNDER the freeway overpasses - it provides a lot of shade for a bunch of people easily (and it was definitely needed on a day like today... whew was it hot), it absorbs the noise from the band, and it gives the overall event a kind of secret gathering feel - if you can have a secret gathering of like 800 people in one place. <br><br>Next, the options. There are a LOT, and that's awesome. Lots of savory and sweet options, but not too many ""creative"" trucks (like Chairman), which is a little disappointing. There are also little artisan crafts stands that are really cute in addition the food trucks, but if you came to a festival called SactoMoFo, your primary goal is probably not to obtain handmade bead necklaces.<br><br>The food. I can't really remark on this too well because the lines were SO FREAKING LONG. I mean like waiting-your-life-away long. Like getting here at 11 and probably having to eat your 11 am purchase for dinner long. I came here with a couple friends and we wanted to try Koja Kitchen but the line was so long that you couldn't even see the truck from the end of the line. The line for RoliRoti was so ridiculous it was shaped like a paper clip - the end was closer to the cashier because it folded in on itself. I get that food trucks have lines, and I'm not unfamiliar to the food truck scene at all. I used to be a pretty frequent regular at Off the Grid in the Haight in SF and there were always lines. But this was just appalling. <br><br>I'm pretty sure I won't be coming back because of the wait but if you're a super early person and you don't mind waiting forever, this will probably be an excellent option.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NEcZ8xGjIwAWXXdKKu7Xfw
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/27/2014,4,"SactoMofo is the kind of event that everyone should attend at least one time just for the experience. I like the location under the freeway even though many yelpers don't agree with me. This location provides decent  cover from the sun and parking spaces are plenty. Here are my food truck reviews:<br>Chairman Bao, delicious steamed buns come in four different types of fillings. I like the tofu and coca cola braised pork. The other two, chicken and BBQ meat are good too. I'm not a fan of their wonton chips.<br>Slightly Skewed, for $11, you can have tasty BBQ meat on a skewer, grilled peppers (my favorite), and rice ball. I'm not a fan of their rice ball but others in my group like it.<br>Krush Burger, they had two trucks at this event, very very delicious tater tots.<br>Cichy Co, we were so hungry waiting in line for Chairman Bao, we ended up order asiago truffles and blue cheese fries, nothing special about their fries but at least no one in my group pass out from hunger while waiting in line.<br>Bacon Mania, everything tastes better with bacon, but I have had much better bacon dishes. <br>We spent around $25-$30 per person on drinks and  food, so technically speaking it wasn't exactly an affordable lunch, but it was a fun lunch with family and friends.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4nQWtdU822xQH2fE0dLTUA

SactoMofo,"Roseville, CA",5/15/2012,4,"For someone with no life, I can't believe I actually attended both SactoMoFo events (last year and this year). It was delightful to see a butt load of food trucks, especially after waiting in different lines for 2-3 hours each on a hot, humid day. The SactoMoFo event last year was insanely scorching hot but I still enjoyed myself. The highlight of last year that I was actually able to try was the Seoul Kitchen tacos --- good way to end the day =) Everything was worth it because friends were there to converse with and to wait in other lines and cut ---- unfortunately, I was a cutter that day; it was the only way I could actually eat! Hahah!<br><br>It was a success last year which is why we had another one this year! Even better, it was under the bridge so the food trucks were in the shade this time and so were the lines.  There were more food trucks this year and definitely more people --- different people from last year though --- last year consisted more of teenagers, young adults, and hipsters, compared to this year which was more older people. This time my boyfriend and I arrived at 12 (started at 11) but even that was a mistake because by the time we got there, there were already huge lines especially for the Nom Nom Truck that I wanted so badly to experience... However, we were able to try the Sanguchon Food Truck (Peruvian), Smoothie Patrol, and the Fish Taco Truck (forgot what it's called). We didn't stay for the entire time like last time, but it was still nice.<br><br>Keep it coming!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u9zqrRSnf6BByCIQ0MIyiA
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",12/3/2011,5,"Sactomofo3 was a success! The lines (with the exception of a few) were nothing compared to Sactomofo1. We didn't attend Sactomofo2 because of our experience at the first festival where we all waited at least an hour and a half for food. My friends and I showed up a little after 11am anticipating long lines and people running around trying to decide which lines to tackle but it was nothing like that. The food trucks were spread out and a few smaller venders and sponsors were there representing and promoting their companies. <br><br>Because of their popularity and being from out of town, Chairman Bao had one of the longest lines. My boyfriend wanted to see what all the hype was about so he waited about 30 minutes and came back with 3 boxes of bao. All were very good and well worth the money for the size. These are not your ordinary Chinese bao but huge Asian style sandwiches filled with meats such as spicy chicken and braised pork belly and special sauces. Don't underestimate this truck, you will leave full and happy. <br><br>After hearing so much about the Wicked 'Wich truck that was my target and lucky for me I only had to wait 5 minutes! For me, this truck was the winner of the few we tried. I loved the crisp seasoned fries and special slaw used in their spicy capicola sandwich. <br><br>My other friend waited about 15 minutes for garlic noodles and egg rolls. I also ordered coconut shrimp and a Vietnamese coffee.  In the end we met up with a larger group of friends and enjoyed a shmorgishborg of everything from corn bread to bacon bacon and waffles.  We were in foodie paradise!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BX-tpDEsVDXwE8ZatbZmRg
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/24/2012,5,"Sacto MoFo 4 was wonderful! I went to the first one last Spring and by comparison, this one had expanded the food truck offerings, picked a shady spot, had an AMAZING line up of musicians and the lines moved pretty quickly. <br><br>There was a Whole Foods truck there and everything they sold was under $5. Pleasant surprise.<br><br>I really like the under the freeway set-up and the music was so so good. Nice job SactoMoFo crew!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DpiMuxg2g4urzClzjykUHg
SactoMofo,"Phoenix, AZ",4/30/2011,3,"I went but didn't get any food because of the lines. Happy to see so much support for food trucks though.<br><br>It's pretty pathetic that the city fears mobile food trucks so much that not only did the health inspectors show up, but also FTB tax inspectors and apparently some other government inspectors as well. I signed the petition and hope everyone else did also.<br><br>Have to agree with those who suggest pre-sale tickets next time and maybe next time limit the trucks to samples that can be handed out quickly to keep the lines moving.<br><br>I'd also like someone to publicize which restaurant owners are opposed to mobile trucks because I would be happy to boycott them.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KTK_ws8lu_TWfR7DtDWjMA
SactoMofo,"San Jose, CA",4/22/2012,4,"Full disclosure: I drove up from the Bay Area to go to SactoMofo 4 because I wanted to check out the Sac food trucks and also to support one of my friends who is a co-organizer of this event.  Thus the 4 stars rating as I'm not a homer just to boost the rating.<br><br>As for the event itself, it was what I expected...no different than any other food truck rally that I had previously attended.  The parking was no problem as there were lots of spaces when I rolled in and long lines for hungry attendees.<br><br>Some trucks were more popular than others thus the lines pushed into 20-30 minutes then there's an additional wait to get the food as well.  For groups that come here, they can do the divide and conquer strategy and be able to hit a bunch of trucks at the same time but since I came here solo, I was only able to hit up two trucks(Drewskis and Chandos Tacos).  <br><br>I was a bit bummed that some tents had already packed up and left, including the Yelp tent.  I had wanted to meet the CM for this area but oh well.  Also, the Addy's paella tent ran out of food an hour before I got there so I missed out on trying their stuff too.  <br><br>I loved the beer garden and it was set up in its own section.  $7 for a glass of Shock Top on a hot day was awesome!  <br><br>Things that I hope that can be brought for the next event: a coffee/espresso cart that can do iced drinks, a BBQ food truck(tri-tip!) for some protein options that isn't offered only in the sandwich form, and a seafood themed truck that may offer deep fried fish/shrimp and chips.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=V5Th21KjUiYLJQyV-vGtpg
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/29/2014,4,"First Sacto foodtruck festival. I was excited to see a few bay area foodtrucks there as well, mainly The Chairman and Kujo, both Asian Fusion trucks. Kujo had the longest line by far, but it moved at double the rate of other lines, so have no fear! Had the bulgogi rice patty sandwich and their fries which were awesome! Finished off with a drink for $14. Only one beer tent, but it had variety including beers, ciders, wines and even those beer-ita things, not sure about those...Seating was adequate which is typically a problem at the Off The Grid's I go to in SF (except Fort Mason) however the ambiance (under a freeway) is highly lacking.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/30/2011,4,"Having finished the event I should probably do a more complete review. Overall I think the event went well, people were nice, nothing bad happened - but obviously there were more people than expected. I hesitate to blame the organizers though - this was after all an outdoor event, with no way to control the number of attendees. If they fenced the event in and turned people away, I think that would have been worse...<br><br>But enough about that, this was about the food. I had food from 6 different vendors over the course of 4 hours, and it was ALL good. Korean tacos, crazy Drewskis sandwiches, popsicles, lumpia, tikka masala burrito...oh man it was tasty. I'm bummed that I can't have this food regularly without chasing down the trucks!<br><br>And how would I have sampled all this tasty food on my own? I wouldn't have.

(2 stars) <br><br>Chairman Bao<br>- Tender Pork Belly<br>- Coco Cola Braised Pork<br>- Spicy Chicken<br><br>All the items I ordered from this food truck looked more eye popping.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",5/2/2011,4,My gf's and I have been waiting for this event for such a long time. So of course we came with a plan of action just in case things got crazy..which they did! We came at 11:30 with a group of 7 people. One person was in charge of the bench that we marked as our meet up place. The other six of us stood in line at different trucks and bought food for the rest of us to share. Thank god we had a plan!! There were so many people and the lines were so freakin long. Our plan was carried out successfully and we were all able to taste a little of something from each truck. YUMMO!<br><br>If Sac decides to do this again next year; I would suggest an entrance fee and alcohol. I know I'd be more patient with a cold brewski in my hand..and a lot more friendly!!,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=RyPeT_ICAtX8ah9dhDpEFw
SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",12/8/2011,4,"SactoMoFo 3<br><br>After the first SactoMoFo event, I made sure I had a backup plan this time. I told myself I wasn't willing to wait in a line for more than an hour. Last time I waited in one line for four hours! There weren't as many people as the last event. Maybe it was because it was cold and windy. Less people = shorter lines. This time I was able to hit up 5 trucks. I was at the event for about two hours.<br><br>If you brought something to donate to Sacramento Food Bank or U.S. Marine Corps Reserve's Toys for Tots, then you were entered in a raffle. It certainly motivated me in donating. I also donated out of the goodness of my heart of course. <br><br>I think the set up was great. There were plenty of parking under the bridge. I didn't have to worry about parking on the street and getting a ticket. There were a good amount of trucks/ vendors.

Who is Hungry? Foodtruck,"El Dorado Hills, CA",8/15/2017,5,"You know I saw this truck by Capitol Park today and I just had to try it.  I have always been a sucker for fried dough and I always get it when I see it at the local fairs.

You can make it sweet or savory, but no matter what it's still good!<br><br>I can't even believe I've never experienced in my 34 years of existence. As I was perusing the food trucks at Off the Grid Sac at the Bar on Saturday evening, this little small truck just sat nestled in the middle of the semi-circle.<br><br>Unassuming and with people sitting outside their food truck offering samples. I walked past twice without trying their sample and kinda just looking. On the third pass by, I finally grabbed a sample AND it was perfect. Fried goodness topped with Nutella!<br><br>I don't mean to belittle their food, but at first experience it was like a funnel cake...but better! Instead of strings of fried goodness, it was one whole flat fried thing of amazingess with the gooey drizzle of Nutella!<br><br>I noticed they did both, sweet and savory. I'd had my eye on the Bacon lover one, but was really jonesing for a gyro that evening. So, I decided to get wild and get my savory fix with my gyro and my sweet fix with the Nutella langos. It was the perfect evening of food truck goodness!<br><br>The lovely lady who was manning the truck was really fun and sweet. She was crazy friendly and took my crazy order without hesitation or ridicule. I had asked to have it cut into pieces to share with the group (like they did with the samples, but not as small) and also only put whip cream on half of it, since it's not my thing...but J loves it. She noted it all and smiled as I paid her. Genuine happiness and awesome service on top of an amazing friend dessert, can't ask for much more than that!<br><br>Seriously, it's fried. It's delicious. It's not overly oily as you'd think something fried would be. The dough inside was still flaky and perfect, but the outside was crunchy.

Fried bread... even better! I sampled the one with sour cream and cheese. I was skeptical at first, but it was so heavenly that I had to get another one for the BF to try. I was debating whether to get a sweet or savory one and finally decided on the veggie one. It had a dill sour cream base and was piled high with fresh veggies like cucumbers, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, spinach, banana peppers and was topped off with feta cheese and a balsamic glaze. This dish was INCREDIBLE! All the ingredients just work so well together. The langos was just a little sweet so that it worked so well with the salty feta. It was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of crunch and chew.<br><br>The owner, Regina, was so sweet and really informative.

But, it was worth the adventure. It was like a Fry Bread pizza with several toppings to choose from. I Tried the Italian toped with Bacon. It's big enough to share. I also tried the Beef Stew. It was like my Grandmothers's  Irish Stew with a kick. It had a tad of spice to it and tasted well simmered like a lot of love was poured into the cooking.  There were even tiny pieces of dumplings that was an added surprise. I'm so glad I tried this. The ladies running the truck were a pleasure to visit with. It made my day. Thank you, looking forward to seeing you again.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QFlIAcg7hg3hZ5fFUppHwA

I buy every time they come around. Their rice plate is mouth watering. I always get the chicken. It comes with a salad too, which is simple, but so good for some reason. Then of course I add the fries for $3 and ask for extra sauce. I'm a saucy girl so I like to bathe my food in deliciousness. Their chicken gyro is really good too, but the rice plates are for the win. Lastly, the customer service ROCKS! The guys are very nice and seem to have the best energy, which makes it nice to visit.

So have my coworkers.  The chicken &amp; rice meal is my go-to item, since the chicken is tender, juicy, and never overcooked. The lamb (I'm very finicky on lamb) is equally good. Produce is always fresh, and their sauces have good flavor.  Get the plate, the gyro, or the fries for something different.  The guys working there are friendly and try to remember their repeat customers.  What more could I want?",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pmLabvtvAOB7rtMh8eoZSw

Tailgater44 Food Truck,"Elk Grove, CA",10/28/2018,4,"I've actually never heard of this food truck until it came to my school for a fundraiser. Luckily, it wasn't too busy at the time I went, so I was able to order right away.<br>My friend and I decided to split the Touchdown (~$12) and Wing-T (~$12). The Touchdown is their marinated tri-tip sandwich with grilled onions and garlic aioli. The Wing-T is an order of crispy adobo full-size wings. It took maybe 15 minutes or so for the order to be ready.<br>The Touchdown was a bit disappointing because the bread was not grilled or even warm. It was just regular hero bread with tri-tip. The tri-tip was ""sauceless"" which is what they're known for, but honestly, it was too dry. I wish there was more garlic spread on it. The Wing-T was pretty good. It was made fresh and was flavorful.<br>The meal is a bit pricey for what I actually received, in my opinion.

Unfortunately, I can't even judge their food, but only their service since I wasn't even served after it was noted they would be open until 8:30 PM. With a growing business with a solid 5 stars, I hope they can be more accommodating to hungry customers. As a fellow Filipino who prides on their culture and supports their people, I can't say a positive thing about this experience with this truck. I arrived around 7:40 PM to find out they were...

We called around and TACOS Pedrito was the first to call us back, and boy are we happy they did. Angi, the owner was easy to work with and super friendly. We worked out an agreement and sent in our deposit. The day of the party they arrived an hour early and setup. They cooked everything fresh on site. We had vege, chicken and beef tacos. It was all you can eat for an hour half. EVERYONE at our party was very satisfied with the husband and wife team and said how delicious the food was.  We highly recommend them and will call on them for our next party.

Tacos Pedrito,"Sacramento, CA",8/7/2017,5,"Discovered this nifty little taco truck a few months ago when they were just starting out. So far we've tried everything in their menu and they're all awesome! Their meat is well seasoned, well prepared. The ingredients they  use are fresh. They're as authentic as the real Oaxaca street tacos as we can get in NorCal. They accommodate all your requests, extra this, crispy that. <br><br>We've come to an extent where I encourage people to try their food, my coworkers, social media followers, friends, neighbors, everybody! That's how we support a good running little local business. We're waiting for Angie and Pedro to have a storefront where we could all sit and dine and just eat all the tacos we can handle. But for now, their budding catering gigs are what's keeping them afloat. So, if you need a taco truck to cater for your birthday, wedding, weekend party, hit them up 'cause they're the best around town! No frills, just simple Mexican food that you'll crave every week and make hnggg noises while you're munching down on their food.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ScLEC2oH3JJg-GFNgVuhkw

Where was the ""INN""????<br><br>George later told us about a company in Nevada who evidently had the rights to the name: SQUEEZE INN. Without trying to lose money through lawsuits, the owners of SI Burgers decided to change the name to the restaurant. Makes sense.

BRILLIANT.....!!!!<br><br>Sabrina made sure our order was perfectly packaged with everything we requested and she actually repeated every item. That was awesome.<br><br>George also asked if we wanted any burger compliments like fries, etc........with this SERVICE, how can you say ""no"". Haha.

Street parking is a must, and lack of seating is not an issue.<br><br>My best friend vouched for their special flavor MINT CHOCOLATE MILKSHAKE, $4.75 for 20 oz. She doesn't like mint but loved the milkshake. Another friend and I ordered a milkshake to share (my biffle wasn't willing to split one boohoo), and boy, that is some good mint chocolate ice cream. Shakes really should be meals in themselves.<br><br>I opted for the $7.75 SQUEEZEBURGER WITH CHEESE, which is a 1/3 lb all-beef patty served on a sesame seed bun and topped with mayonnaise, mustard, dill pickle, tomato, onion, and lettuce. All their burgers ordered with cheese default to this crazy ""skirt"" of fried cheese, which is optional. And holy, they aren't kidding when they say it's a LOT of cheese, and it is DELICIOUS. Yes, you'll need to strip your burger of the skirt before you can actually eat your burger, but the cheese is fun to munch on by itself. I asked for my burger to be medium-rare, and while it was more medium than mare, this is a SOLID burger. It's like if In-N-Out made larger, heartier burgers. The bun is soft and soaks up the oil well, the ingredients are fresh, the meat is a juicy, and the cheese skirt is ridic. This is a danged good burger!<br><br>We also ordered 2 LARGE FRIES at $4.25 a pop. One large order feeds 2-4 people, meaning we should have stopped at 1 order haha.

I could've gone to the store and bought myself five salads worth of lettuce for the price they asked.<br>Speaking of how much... it was 30 dollars for two orders of their chicken with a salad?

Sophia’s Mini Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",9/9/2016,5,"Fresh tasting, good quality, and value.  <br><br>I get it, food at events costs a bit more.  it's inevitable.  That said, too often food trucks have me thinking, ""Hmmm, I could get a better product at a restaurant with wait services for less.""  It makes me consider eating before an event I know is catered by food trucks. If all food trucks delivered the quality and value of Sophia's I wouldn't think that way.  <br><br>Twice I've gotten substantial, fresh tasting beef wraps loaded with good looking produce rather than iceberg lettuce that just adds crunch.  Seven bucks. Not skimpy with meat either. <br><br>Sometimes I look for non-gut bomb items.  Wraps are gyros hit the spot. Some other trucks charge $12 or more for their wraps. You can't go wrong here though.  <br><br>Next time you see that orange truck try it.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZbHkj6HH4udAwi6MMx2SjA

I love the seasoning and the chutney dipping sauce goes really well with it. I was less impressed with the salad and rice. The rice was laking in flavor and the salad was actually rather bland. The white sauce that is drizzled over the beef and salad was also rather bland today. Thank goodness the beef itself was flavored well and didn't rely solely on the white sauce.<br><br>I don't really know what happened, but other than the beef, everything was so different from my first experience with Sophia's. <br><br>Everyone else in my party, who had also tried Sophia's the first time with me, agreed that something was different.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/29/2015,4,"i have heard about this event from Facebook. i have been to this kind of event a few times, but this my 2nd time coming to this location. the food here seems very different and interesting and wanting to come here and try all of them. personally i am a fan of this idea and is great to explore if your a foodie. <br><br>i do notice most of the trucks do have a location somewhere and serve it not just only in the food trucks. i tend to lean to the idea of just visiting the shop and get it there and its way quicker than the lines at the food truck event. for example krush burgers do have a restaurant in sac and i do prefer to go there and get whatever i need i can get from the food truck locations as well. i know theres a bit of difference where they do have special items which the food truck serves and the restaurant doesn't. an example would be the salmon blt is what i rave about krush burgers food truck menu and in the restaurant that item isn't served so there is a little bit of difference. overall if your just craving the regular popular most sale item then going to the restaurant can solve all the line waiting during the food truck items. <br><br> i have mention the above paragraph because i have wanted to try a food truck and instead the lines were ridiculous long and i didn't want to wait over an hour for what i can get by just going to their restaurant for the exact same item without the wait. <br><br>this event does gather up all the different cities food trucks to this gigantic food truck event. some other cities such as stockton or sf local food trucks. i do see more people going tot he sf food truck more than the other food trucks. i know this event is one of the biggest one and i believe it happens once a year so make sure you get there an hour earlier before the open time to avoid the line waiting and also for the parking as well. <br><br>parking can be a problem to this kind of large event, because in the area it is crowded with people and cars and might take some delay. sometimes parking can be charge but i do recommend you follow or read their Facebook event to avoid charges such as donating a can food to avoid the parking charge for example. <br><br>overall most items from these food trucks events are average to be around 10 bucks for an entree. they do tend to get expensive if you try multiple food trucks. the best way is to gather a few friends to have them wait in each different lines and share the food in a family style way. also sharing helps cut costs down as well. i think this is one of the best way to explore what you like and just stick with which carts attracts you. <br><br>i have done the family style sharing food kind of way but each person get their food at different times.sometimes the food is cold by the time the food is all gather up. sometimes the items is the best when you receive it because its hot and warm and not cool down by the time you wait to eat all together. <br><br>just be prepare to wait in line for these events. wear something comfortable such as sneakers because there will be plenty of standing around waiting. also i do recommend bringing hand sanitize and wet wipes to clean hands after handling the cash to pay for your food. bring some water bottle as well because drinks and bottle water can be expensive. also might bring a hat or fan or an umbrella sometimes its under the hot scorching sun and are mostly outdoors in different locations. overall its a fun family friendly environment and crowded with lots of people. <br><br>overall after a few of these events i have analyzed i rather just go to a nice sit down  restaurant and eat because after paying for what i get from the food trucks are sometimes not worth it. although it is a different experience but I'm like wow with money i have spend and  going through all the long lines doesn't seem to worthy of it. hope this review help and gave you some tips. happy yelping and don't forget to vote. have a great day!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gtJsj5RpF4dfE7uPVDRfDQ

SactoMofo,"Fair Oaks, CA",4/27/2013,5,"First off, this is a HUGE event. 30+ trucks and hundreds of people. If you're expecting to get your food fairly quickly, this is not the place for you. Most lines are a minimum 20-30 min wait to get your food (and some are close to an hour). However, its great if you have a plan and aren't expecting to get in and get out. I've done this event, and others like it, many times: the best way to do it is to find a long line to wait in and split up to go get other food and bring it back. Works great. <br><br>Second, it is under the freeway, but that doesn't effect it at all. The noise from the cars overhead isn't an issue, there isn't any car fumes, and the freeway means that the event is shaded. There's also quite a bit of parking around the event, so you don't have to walk very far. It is also a non-smoking event, so that's one less thing you have to worry about.<br><br>Get there early (gets REALLY busy around noon) and be prepared to wait in lines. Bring cash just incase a truck doesn't take cards (or the card reader isn't working), and just relax. Yes, there are some trucks that cost $10 for two tacos, but there are many that have great deals when it comes to cost compared to portion. I've visited dozens of trucks, and I haven't found anything that I haven't liked. Its all about being open and willing to try some new things.<br><br>I wait for this event every year, and I highly encourage everyone to try it out.

The fries were seasoned just right and the ratio of fries to mac n' cheese was acceptable. Not too much but not too little. However, everything on their menu had bacon in it except that it was just a tiny sprinkle. It reminded me of the bacon bits out of a can you can get at the grocery store.

Bacon MANia Truck,"Sacramento, CA",5/20/2013,1,"BaconMania = Food Truck FAIL<br><br>I love bacon and I love food trucks, so when I saw the BaconMania Food Truck at a SactoMofo event, the first words out of my mouth were ""score""!  Wow, what a disappointment.  I ordered the Piggy Fries for $8 and the Bacon Wrapped Mac for $5 and I seriously think I'd prefer eating at McDonalds before I eat from the BaconMania truck again (side note- I haven't eaten from McDonalds in 10 years, no joke).<br><br>The Piggy Fries were supposed to be crispy fries topped with BBQ pulled pork and cole slaw.  Sounds delicious, right? WRONG!!!!  The fries were a far cry from crispy, in fact they were damn near cold and raw.  What made it worse was that these cold, non-crispy fries were cooked in bacon fat, which completely overpowered the taste of potato making the fries into soggy, wet sticks of bacon fat flavor.  Now, on top of these oh so non-wonderful fries, was their pulled pork and cole slaw.  The meat itself was tender and flavorful, but the BBQ sauce was ridiculously spicy, even for me.  I love spicy food, but this kind of spicy was most unpleasant!!!  Not to mention the soggy cole slaw that was probably sitting in its own dressing for far too long.  It tasted like it was coated in a sour cream, vinaigrette, which was disgusting and was probably the worst cole slaw I've ever had.  In fact, I think my middle school cafeteria made better cole slaw.  <br><br>What really pushed me over the edge was the Bacon Wrapped Mac.  I got two Mac balls a little bigger than the size of a golf ball and a side of cole slaw for the high price of $5.  Ugh, considering the cole slaw was a joke, you're telling me I paid $2.50 for each Bacon Wrapped Mac Ball when Kraft's Mac and Cheese from a box is better than the Mac I had from the BaconMania Truck.  As I said before, sheer disappointment and food truck failure.  <br><br>I don't know if they were having a terrible day, but considering Sacramento has some of the best food trucks, BaconMania better step up their game or move out!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3cJsY18AzCmb-JzEF1Kizw

It was the first time I had ever had anything like that, but it was delicious.  I think it's amazing when you can take concepts from 3 cultures and blend them into something so tasty.  My prediction for the future is that mobile food Korean Taco truck model becomes a franchise like Panda did to chinese food when it was still good.   <br><br>Things that could have been done better: I should have surrounded South Side Park rather than be under the freeway - although the shade was nice under there.  Also, I think it should run through dinner time - at least until 8pm so that those hard working folks that also work on Saturdays have a chance to get off work and make it down to the Sacto MoFo.<br><br>Overall - great, especially in the face of Sacramento's war on mobile food trucks, right as it gains popularity...

I truly appreciate you. <br><br>   I just got to get this off my chest. I don't get why grown ass adults leave bad yelp reviews on new, local, privately owned small businesses. Even if you did not like it or you feel that they did not do a good job, why bitch about it. What do you get out of that? Do you want them to fail? Do you want them to lose business? What do you know about food? Maybe a lot, maybe nothing, but who cares. Next time you eat at a new place and you don't like it... don't bitch or cry about it on yelp. It just makes you look like an idiot. So please if you are older than 21 and you don't like someone's food that they tried real hard to make it for you... be the the bigger person that day and move on with your life.

YC Catering,"Stockton, CA",8/29/2018,5,"Caught this truck randomly , don't usually see them here. A man works here with his young daughter, nice to see that... He was super friendly and passionate about his food and explained his dishes since my husband and I weren't sure what we were ordering. We're not familiar with Puerto Rican food at all , but I know good food, and this place really had me impressed. He bragged about his tacos and he did not exaggerate , they were as delicious as he claimed. Like ridiculously good. My only complaint is at $8 for two tacos , I would expect a side of rice and beans... But I still recommend these tacos as a must, they are worth it! I work all the time to hunt them down, but if I see them there , I'm there for sure. Treat yourself and give this place a try.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CxshYsDEJL57HHmXgliAXQ

I love finadeni and was excited when I discovered them on social media. I've had YC 3 times so far and figured now was time to leave this review. Huli Huli chicken is always juicy chicken thigh meat and the sauce is so good. Tonight they suggested for me to try the house spicy sauce and it was THE BOMB especially mixed the the finadeni poured on the rice.

With my girlfriend being half Guamanian and myself being half Puerto Rican, you would imagine how mind-boggled we were to see that a truck like this even existed, let alone in Stockton! So of course we had to try it. <br><br>We ordered the chicken kelaguen typhoon taco plate and an extra taco on the side of the same meat. It comes with two nice-sized portions of red rice, a shrimp patty, finadene dipping sauce and two huge typhoon tacos. It's really such a beautiful plate and the taco shells are amazing!!!!!!!<br><br>I've eaten authentic Chamorro food and this truck is the real deal. The red rice has a light but delicious flavor that doesn't overpower the tacos and compliments it very well. The chicken kelaguen had so much flavor, was nice and tender and not watery (which I've seen happen far too many times) but not dry (which also happens far too often). The only thing I wish I had a little more spice and flavor from was the finadene, I tasted a bit too much soy sauce. I'm not a big fan of shrimp patties but decided to try it anyway and it was good and filled with more than I expected!<br><br>Overall, I would come back time and time again without a doubt.

I'm not going to compare it to one of the best in the U.S. "Katz's Delicatessen" in New York because that place is ridiculous good but in California I'd say it's one of the best.

You can also find free parking on the street. It was nice that this event was held under the freeway since it was very hot. The wait was about 20-30 min for the popular food trucks. My friends and I decided to split and lined up to different food trucks. As a result, we ended up with lots of food to share. There was plenty of seating area but we had to share with other people since there was hardly any empty spaces. We brought our own drinks to save money as well. Most the food trucks accept credit/debit cards but bring cash just in case.

The food was all great. The Korean tacos were tasty as were the baos and samosas. It is no surprise that these ""gourmet"" food trucks had long waits. This type of food is labor intensive to make. We also had the Fat Face popsicles. Pretty tasty and sometime odd flavor combos.<br><br>The people: 5 stars. Couldn't believe how patient people were (for the most part). Very laid back, relaxed atmosphere. Had some nice conversations with randoms in line while waiting. I guarantee you; the scene in NY/ LA would not have looked like this. Probably a good idea not to allow beer/ apply for an alcohol permit. Would have been totally different.<br><br>All in all; a cool experience.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",10/26/2011,2,"I've been contemplating my review for this event for the past few months. It's said that one should not speak when angry or frustrated. The wrong words just come out. But although it took place a while ago, I still can't shake my frustration with how the event turned out.<br><br>I loved the idea of a food truck congregation. I was in-favor of the petitions to save these businesses. I happily signed them. I want them to continue feeding me! D:<br><br>But my god -- the LINES?! They were ridiculous. Yes, people love food. They love to try food. This was a gathering for all the foodies in the area. And if people are patiently waiting to eat, there should be more consideration for line order. I witnessed so many 'cuts.' And acquaintance from high school asked me if he could cut, but I refused. It would have disrespected the other people who were in line with me. <br><br>Two and a half hours later, I got my buns from Chairman Bao. I ran to my boyfriend, who was in line for Seoul on Wheels. He waited about three or more hours while I was in the other line. And right as we were nearing the front, the imposed limit on the food went from $12 to $6. I sympathize with the businesses that didn't anticipate the amount of patrons, but really?! Some people bought a hundred tacos in that line as the event started. If they're going to impose a monetary amount on the food purchased, they should have thought of that sooner. It simply was not fair to the other people who wasted their time, waiting in that line. And I'm totally calling out all those groups that cut in front of me. ...REALLY?! SO DISRESPECTFUL. <br><br>Yay for the food trucks, but boo to how it was ran. I'm crossing my fingers for a more efficient event next time. Don't disappoint.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SCVXTOahtPQJ7i_ZHHgREg

I didn't quite know what to order so I asked them what they normally eat when they want something. And they made me the most delicious plate of food that has ever touched my lips. I cried, then before I knew it the heavens opened up and I was ascending to heaven. I couldn't take in my surroundings because I was still so destracted by the peice of art I was feasting upon. Angels themselves then cried upon my plate in approval of my choice of lunch. I knew at this point I would be accepted amongst the heavens.

Hefty Gyros,"Sacramento, CA",4/26/2015,4,"I came here unexpected, since my top list was to try kola and chairman food truck  but the lines were over an hr wait which i gave up because i was hungry. I then stumbled upon this place and gave it a try. <br><br>This place was on the less busy side so of course the line was fast and the food was fast as well to my expectations. I had went and order their chicken rice plate. Which was char grilled chicken and rice pilaf with sauces on top a white and red color one. The white sauce reminds me of a salad dressing and the red one is a spicy sauce which reminds me of sriracha. There was also a side salad as well with the white salad dressing on top. The lettuce was simple with red onions, tomatoes, cucumber as well.<br><br>While waiting in line i noticed they had pictures of their food on the food truck to show people what it looks like, the prices were hard to see til you step closer then you the number which was written with a silver marker. now onto the food.....  <br><br>The plate was inside a flat white box. it was more of a rectangle shape. the weight of it was filling. when i opened it, the presentation wasn't the nicest or too appealing. looks like too much sauce on top and covers the meat and the salad as well. When my friend saw it he was like wow it looks different, to me i knew exactly what it is so it wasn't so surprising.  <br><br>the rice pilaf was on the dryer side and was also on the hard side as well. But the rice was mixed in with the sauce and chicken so cant really tell that its dry. the dry rice blends in well with the sauces and chicken as well. the rice wasn't on the fluffy side, like i have tried at other places. The chicken was warm not hot, seem like it was sitting in a steam table maybe to keep warm. The chicken was on the bland side but can taste some char grilled flavor to it. The sauces on top was good as well not very heavily flavor sauces. The red one i requested for extra hot and it taste medium to me. If you cant eat hot you can request it on the side or else you did be burning up. The salad was fresh and crisp so that was on point. <br><br>For me as a hungry person it was great overall cant expect it to be outstanding from a food truck which they might already prepared all the work ahead of time so the waiting time wouldn't  be that long and it was true took about 5 mins for my food to come up. <br>this wouldn't be my first choice but if i wasn't that hungry then i would have waited for other food trucks, but when i am hungry i get cranky. foodie problems, but i thought the food i received was well worth it. the portion size was very generous and the chicken was a lot and the rice was well balanced as well. the salad was great as well with portion size, i felt like it was worth the 9 bucks and it did filled me up. <br><br>the service was friendly and quick. They did try to upwell their orders by saying if you wanted to add this and that or make it a combo. i thought it was very smart but i already had what i wanted in mind so i didn't need all the extra sides because i rather try other food trucks since i am there. Their fries are very reasonable for 3 bucks and looked saucy as well. maybe next time i will give that a try and their pita sometime soon. will have to update my review soon once i try other items as well. hope you enjoy my review and have a nice day my yelp friends. stay yelping and vote for me and add me as well hehe the more friend the better yelp is :)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=gtJsj5RpF4dfE7uPVDRfDQ

We choose spicy again and it was sooo good! 5 stars for food &amp; service. <br><br>However... on a side note. We were a little weary at first of ordering because one of the servers was smoking near the food truck. Nothing against smokers but with food and using your hands and a food truck.. I'm glad we decided to order anyway based on Yelp reviews but maybe just remember that your guests are really watching things like this and paying attention :),https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9AUZrHtdSAaxeCbNBKHOdA

I wish I had read the reviews prior to ordering, they are overall bad... <br><br>Like others we were at Tilted Mash on a Friday evening. Hubby hopped in line to order the mushroom sandwich and order of Sriracha fries. After a 30 min wait they called his name. This sad looking sandwich with a side of garlic fries came out. I immediately said this is not what we ordered, so hubby went back to the truck to complain. He was told he DIDNT order sriracha fries..... let me say this, my hubby hates garlic fries so I know the owner was tripping. Also they gave him a meal which was a side of fries with sandwich Not the actual order of fries like we ordered.<br><br>Needless to say we gave the food back, got Zero apology, and plain lame customer service. Though we paid with a card they gave us cash back.  I guess when there's no other food option folks think it's ok to be rude.

At that point a woman working in the truck said, ""Ma'am, I see you getting annoyed, and you need to know we make everything fresh."" It was said in an incredibly snotty tone.

I had heard of this happening other yelpers in the past, but I'd never experienced it myself personally, but today I got a ""compliment"" from the owner of this food truck critiquing my review of his business.  I found this to be especially interesting based off the fact that this same owner of the same business provided me a very different compliment 5 months ago based off of this exact same review. <br><br>When I reviewed this place for the first time five months ago, the owner contacted me and offered to make me the same sandwiches again and offered an apology for a misunderstanding about my order. Seemingly because I have not taken him up on his offer, he has decided to criticize my review instead of exploring new ways to offer a more quality product to customers. I understand that when it's your business it's difficult not to take critiques personally, but I was trying to give  feedback based off of my experiences with other food trucks in the area.  I felt that my feedback was honest and pointed out positives along with areas for improvement.  As someone who was born and raised in the area, I love seeing all of these small businesses prosper, but you're not going to be successful if you're not open to a little constructive criticism.<br><br>Unfortunately based off of the principles of this owner, and their exorbitant prices for their mediocre food, I will not be frequenting this business again.

The Dirty Bird had what I'm guessing was a frozen, breaded chicken patty, some Franks Buffalo sauce, and a little bit of basic slaw on a basic bun. It was ok but not worth $7. The garlic fries on the other hand were great!  The fries were thick and crinkle cut.

I can tell they were busy but didn't expect what we experienced. I ordered my food. Barbacoa tacos 3 for $11, a kids burger, fries and 1 burger. A total of $31. Kinda pricey truck. We waited for 1 hour and 45 minuets for our food!!! It was absolutely ridiculous we were hangry and hot. I asked very politely when our order would be ready and the lady said soon we are backed up. I understood but was starting to feel frustrated because when we ordered our food we were told 20 min for the wait. I think the reason why she was telling people that is so they wouldn't lose business if she was honest with how long it was really going to be. During the wait I was told by others that several orders were somehow thrown away and they messed up. At this pont they should have offered refunds to everyone and just given them the food. They were very unprepared for today. We finally received our food the fries were SOAKED IN GREASE, the tacos were so gross, The burger was good. I'll give that to them.

The fries from Cali love were pretty good, I like them super salty and over seasoned, so that was perfect. But you can tell they were just out of the freezer basic shoe string fries. Not very many ether. After finishing the meal, I could have bought another burger and fries to fill up. Also... explosive diarrhea. My work suite ate there, 3 of the 7 of us ate the burger for lunch, by 4:30 pm (about 4 hours after eating) all three of us had amazing explosive diarrhea.

I looked at the menu and saw Mac &amp; Cheese, which I normally love, and seasoned fries (the menu says they are seasoned with salt and pepper). At $8, the mac &amp; cheese was a large portion. I'll give them that, but it was salty. I normally enjoy salt, but it was not ideal for mac &amp; cheese and the food temp was warm, not hot. The fries were also a large portion at $6, but were not hot (instead, they were lukewarm) and only salted (no pepper).

Cons of the sandwich: super thick bun, the bun was clearly old so it was hard to chew through, it was extremely dry, no sauce, no flavor, and I kept getting pieces of cartilage.

I used a middleman via Roaming Hunger, to make all arrangements prior to the event. Turns out, when Tailgater44 arrived, they had very little info on the specifics and they arrived earlier than expected (because such info was not given to them). This was not an issue with Tailgater44. They were so helpful, very professional, and resourceful. As well, their staff were so nice to work with and they worked well with the wait staff. Everything came together exactly how we imagined. The food was superb!! Our guests kept commenting on the good food and many went up for seconds. Being it was 108 degrees we were so thankful they were more than willing to cater our event as a buffet, indoors.

Squeeze Burger,"Davis, CA",6/25/2015,4,"I've heard about Squeeze Inn for some time now, but I finally got to try it. And it didn't disappoint! For those of you not in the know, Squeeze Inn is all about their famous cheese skirt. I'm sure if you take a quick look at the photos of the food you'll see it. Basically it looks like the planet Saturn where the burger is the ball and the cheese skirt is the big ring around it... but instead of rocks and ice, it's this huge flat thing of cheese.<br><br>The cheese ring looks a bit scary at first, and even on the menu they say that it isn't for everyone, but I really enjoyed the taste of it. It has the taste of the harder cheese that sometimes falls off to the side of the grill or frying pan when making a grilled cheese sandwich. It is YUMMY.<br><br>As good as it tastes, you can immediately tell it's probably one of the most unhealthy things you could eat on the face of the earth. It is extremely oily to say the least. For me, I just decided to eat some parts of it and let the rest go. I'm not sure my heart could handle the entire thing.<br><br>As for the burger, I'd have to say it was definitely above average. It's not the most juicy burger ever, but the toppings and ingredients were fresh and crunchy. It's a solid burger that I wouldn't mind having again for sure.<br><br>The fries are average, but you get quite a bit, even with the smallest size.<br><br>In terms of the staff, they were very friendly and welcoming. They even invited me to fill my drink up before leaving the restaurant.<br><br>Overall I'd have to recommend the Squeeze Inn just to experience the famous cheese skirt. It's definitely something that is unique to this restaurant!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=SZjPJt05qlndeYZ6f45wjQ

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",3/13/2016,4,"If you have a hankering for cheese then stop in and check out the infamous squeeze with cheese.  Its a cheeseburger that has been loaded to the max with a huge handful of cheesey gooey grilled crazyness.<br>The original location off of fruitridge rd in Sacramento was the wicked old location that started it all for squeeze with cheese. It has also been featured on multiple television shows including Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives with Guy Fieri and the Travel Channel's Food Paradise.  Which also lead to alot of people coming in for this and do to its oldness and not fully up to handicap standards it was shut down and reopened. And a few more locations boomed in its glory of cheese. <br>All cheese burgers come with the ""cheese skirt"" so if your not in the mood for cheese of this extreme just ask for no skirt. But hey it still costs the same so i would get it for a picture and just to try the cheesey grilledness of it all. They make it by putting the cheese over the burger and then more cheese so it goes all around the  burger, then add a little ice to the sides and cover it with a box type lid and boom, the skirt is made.<br>They do have add on toppings like (canned) mushrooms, jalapeños, avocado, bacon and a few other items and you can also add these to your fries as well.<br>The standard burgers come as 1/3 lb and if you want a slighty smaller burger they have them too at 1/4 lb size for about $1+/- less. <br>For this location pretty clean, bar style seating with some tables and even a outside patio.<br>The milkshakes are really good, we had the pistachio flavor of the month and hit the spot. I read on the webiste that it takes a while to make em and few other things about them.

I'm a big guy, but if I eat a sandwich, side, and drink I'm stuffed. The side of fries is lightly seasoned and tasty, but I rather get my side at T&amp;R. <br><br>The average meal here is $17 ($12 Sandwich and $5 Side). If the sandwich was smaller and total meal price was in the  $10-15 area I would come here more than once a month. <br><br>Taste wise it's crunchy and can be hot depending on your taste level.  At the top of the scale, The Cluckin Hot is hot but still edible. I often find myself sweating with a tingle of endorphins or something in the back of my head. If you have a high heat tolerance, you might find it not that hot, but for me, it was the perfect level of spice that you want to eat. I'll also note that my friend thought the sandwich was a little greasy and the another said it was alright, but for me it was pretty good.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DuBxGulKTyIN8kDzH_LUsw
Nash & Proper,"Sacramento, CA",10/19/2018,5,"I've never been to Nashville, but I've eaten a lot of fried chicken from a lot of different places and Nash &amp; Proper is by far one of the best. Cooking a satisfying piece of fried chicken is a delicate art form that the guys in this little food truck have already perfected. <br><br>We showed up when they had a mini-residency in the T &amp; R Taste of Texas parking lot in Oak Park. I was starving and ordered the chicken ""sammich"", secretly hoping that it would both fill my belly and satisfy. And that it did. It was a huge, generous piece of fried goodness with a medium kick, pickles and sauce. I especially liked the thick, crispy breading. I barely finished the thing considering that every other bite I took was of their crinkle fries seasoned with a delicious season salt. <br><br>I felt bad that all the business that evening seemed to be for Nash &amp; Proper and not T &amp; R, especially since everyone was sitting on T &amp; R's patio and using their facilities. I assume they have a good deal worked out, but we bought our sodas from T &amp; R all the same. <br><br>My only suggestion is linking a website to your Yelp page (or alternatively answering the phone) so that people know where you've set up shop.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o5STsEtfvD1Ig0J7Z-1uxA
Nash & Proper,"Sacramento, CA",10/23/2018,5,"This truck is truly a blessing from the fried chicken gods. I've been on the prowl wanting to try Nash &amp; Proper and I've finally done it. They have a little spot in the parking lot of T &amp; R Taste of Texas and I went to get my fried chicken fix around 6:30pm just in time for dinner. My 1st impression upon arriving was the decent amount of people hanging out around the truck waiting for food and not for T &amp; R. Not sure their affiliation outside of parking lot partners but people in line for food is always a good sign to me. The truck itself is rather small compared to your typical food truck but don't worry! They deliver on the chicken! <br><br>I split items off the menu with my significant other and we were so impressed! We ordered ""The Sammich"" (mild heat) and an order of wings (medium heat). Both rather large servings, they filled us up with some leftover. With the main entrees, I ordered a side of crinkled french fries, potato salad, and couldn't resist getting some extra pickles on the side. <br><br>The Sammich is huge. A large juicy chicken breast breaded to perfection topped with pickles and slaw. I was really impressed on how large the breast was and how juicy every bite was. The chicken to bread ratio is like 55/45 and im 100% ok with that. The slaw comes a little spicy but compliments the chicken perfectly. <br><br>The Wings come whole, really decent sized for 3 and another slam dunk next to the Sammich. Worked on those with the side of pickles and I can't compliment better on how evenly breaded and cooked the chicken was. I was also a huge fan of the crinkle fries. A single order can easily feed 2. The potato was my least favorite item and I probably would skip it next time I go. <br><br>My overall experience was great. I was instantly sold when 1st walking up to the truck and they had freshly made fried chicken on the other side of the glass staring me down. The guys working the truck were chill. We waited about 10 minutes for our meals I finished my meal ready for round 2.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=zVS87nG7hFqkXO_auvVAIw
Nash & Proper,"San Jose, CA",11/8/2018,5,"I rarely venture to our state's capital, but I was in town for an interview and made the mistake of looking up beforehand what I should eat in Sacramento. Cue me fantasizing about hot chicken throughout the entire interview day. <br><br>Rating Breakdown:<br>2/2 Stars for Taste --<br>I ordered The Sammich because imo dark meat is where it's at. I ordered spice level mild because I was about to start a 2-hour drive and I didn't want to accidentally rub my eye and die in a horrific car accident. The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and the meat itself was so freaking juicy that, upon biting into it, juice spurted onto my glasses. MY GLASSES! The pickle and the slaw provided a bit of a tang to cut through the spicy meatiness of the giant slabs of chicken on top. The bread was ridiculously soft and quickly soaked through with chicken juice. YUM. <br><br>1/1 Stars for Value --<br>Now $12 is not cheap for a sandwich but I have easily paid $5 more for burgers that had 25% as much meat. They are super generous with the chicken. I ended up only eating half of the sandwich and my sister took the other half to work for lunch the next day. I do wish that the price included a small side, but I wouldn't have been able to finish it anyways. <br><br>1/1 Stars for Customer Service --<br>The food truck workers are super friendly and the food came out fast...and HOT. There's utensils and napkins in a basket in front of the truck.<br><br>Bonus star because if I'm ever in Sacramento again, I have to take my sister to try this place. And if they ever decide to branch out to the Bay Area....my diet is doomed.<br><br>TL;DR -- The Sammich is where it's at.

Sac doesn't have any Nashville style chicken that I know of so this new addition it awesome. <br><br>I tried the sammich with medium spice and got an order of the crinkle fries. I could've went without the fries because the sandwich is huge!!! The fries were a little too salty for my liking but no biggie. The sammich was super filling that my boyfriend and I shared it and we still didn't finish it. The chicken wasn't dry at all and the spices on it were great. I'll prob try the clucking hot spice level because medium didn't taste like much since I love spicy!!<br><br>If you want to try them def check them out during the week at their post it spot which is outside a bbq joint. There's no shade for outdoor seating but you can sit inside the small restaurant. No AC in there either but I guess you get some shade!

It comes with coleslaw, jalapenos, cilantro, and pickles. We both got it in the medium. It was the perfect amount of spice for me. So good. <br><br>Now is this Nashville Hot Chicken?

Currently recovering from a hard-hitting food coma after my first visit to Nash &amp; Proper.  Man, was it good.<br><br>On Tuesdays through Thursdays, Nash &amp; Proper is open in the parking lot of a barbecue joint on Broadway in Oak Park.  We swung by around 11:45am and were glad to see that there wasn't a long wait - only a few people in line and waiting for their orders.<br><br>We ordered A LOT:<br>- 1 order of the 1/4 bird - medium spicy<br>- 2 sammiches - mild<br>- 1 order of wings - mild<br>- 2 orders of fries - one unsalted, one regular<br>- 1 side of fuego sauce<br><br>Okay, so maybe we were eating with our eyes, but our coworkers were excited when we came back to the office with plenty of food to share!  The chicken, regardless of whether it was in the sandwich or eaten on its own as wings or thigh, was so deliciously moist on the inside and crispy on the outside.  Depending on your spice level, your chicken will have more or less of a cayenne kick.  Medium was good for me, with that subtle heat creeping up on the back-end, but not to the point of overwhelming my senses.<br><br>The fries came with a barbecue sauce, but ordering the fuego sauce (shoutout to my fellow Yelpers for the suggestion) was a great addition to the meal.  Because the sauce typically only comes on the sammich and I ordered the 1/4 bird (which comes with bread and pickles, but no sauce), I had the option of slathering on a bit of the fuego sauce with each bite as I pleased.<br><br>Despite sharing the food with our coworkers, we still have a lot of leftovers, which I'm happy to graze on throughout the rest of the day, or save for lunch tomorrow.  I'm looking forward to trying their potato salad, and will definitely be back for more chicken!  So cluckin' good.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=JTCtZoj8AjijcQptWAFxwQ
Nash & Proper,"Sacramento, CA",10/16/2018,4,"Chicken was delicious.  I ordered the ""quarter bird,"" which is a boneless leg &amp; thigh, breaded and deep fried to crispy perfection and not too oily. Seasoned enough, with the right amount of salt and flavor.  They put the large piece of chicken on top of 2 slices of white bread (basically to soak up the grease) and throw 3 pickles on top.  I chose medium spicy level, but it tasted more mild with just a tiny kick to it.  Might have to go for the next level of heat and hope I can handle it.   I thought the price point was just a dollar or 2 too much for just chicken and no side.  But I'm cheap.  Still...a winner, winner chicken dinner!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4x3x0oGs9gcHCoQpqoI9hw

Huge wings for $10. Worth the price. Ordered it medium and it had a Smokey spicy flavor to it. Peeled off the skin to try just the meat  and it was so flavorful! I like that the seasoning isn't just on the skin. <br><br>All in all I am following them on Instagram. They are worth the 1 hour drive to Sac.

People kept going on and on about how monstrously huge it was and that two people couldn't finish it.  The pictures also showed a huge piece of chicken that overflowed from the bun, so I was expecting a behemoth.  I would say it was slightly larger than average.  If you're hungry, you can definitely finish the portion I got.  I don't have the biggest appetite, yet it was pretty easy to finish; and based on the previous pictures, I feel like they're shrinking the portions of the chicken by about 3-5 bites.  Honestly, I think the 4x4 from In N Out was bigger in the meat department.  However, it's still quite delicious so definitely get some spicy fried chicken if you're in the neighbourhood.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=x2ztVnpEzkol4yA59IXRAA

It was topped with their pickled slaw, pickles, and their special ranch sauce. It's a very simple concept, but again, super delicious. The tenders were also cooked very well, and were super tasty. I recommend their house ranch with it. <br><br>Location: Because they are a food truck, they are always around. But if you follow them on instagram they detail their weekly locations doe your reference. <br><br>Customer Service: Everyone their was friendly and welcoming. <br><br>Overall: Absolutely love this please, and will definitely come back.

After hearing about the horror stories from my cousin who attended the first MoFo, I was worried I would have to wait 4 hours in line for a Chairman Bao. Luckily, this was not the case. Even coming at prime lunch time, we didn't have to wait longer than 15 minutes at any of the five trucks I visited. (Portions are small, ok? Don't judge.) There was also a good selections of trucks from both the Sacramento and Bay Area, including Seoul on Wheels, Japacurry and An the Go. What was mind-boggling was that the line was twice as long for the local Mini Burger Truck as it was for any SF truck. You'd think people would want to try out something more exotic since MBT is relatively accessible for Sacto residents. I guess it's that good!<br><br>The only complaint I had is that the seating was a bit limited and a bit dirty. Old food and garbage was left on the tables so we ended up just eating in the car.

Squeeze Burger,"Boston, MA",9/4/2015,4,"Y'all already know the deal: cheese skirts. The reason people flock to the Squeeze Inn, myself included, is for the famed cheese skirt - a delicious, melted and crispy coating of cheese that oozes out of your burger and onto the grill and is then served for a beautiful overload of cheesy goodness. <br><br>I may have gained about 10 pounds just from looking at my burger, let alone consuming it and a good portion of a milkshake and fries, but it was so worth it. <br><br>Set up as a casual eatery, we found our waitress to be kind and attentive. She could have been a monster and I probably wouldn't have cared because I was having a love affair with my cheeseburger.<br><br>Seriously if you're not a cheese fan, this place is not for you. And don't go into this place counting calories...just, don't. But if you're down for a once in a lifetime, heart attack inducing meal, this is your spot. <br><br>I opted for the classic Squeezeburger with cheese, Squeeze Inn serves a number of different options with everything from mushrooms to jalapenos but I felt the classic had the perfect amount of flavor and didn't need any extras. The burger was cooked perfectly and retained a lot of juiciness. This place would be one thing if it was just an average burger with an inordinate amount of cheese, but it's entirely another because the burger is actually great, with or without the cheese (but of course the extra cheese doesn't hurt).",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rrLKJ1tq0uDMeizJdF2LsA

The shade was key, as it was over 90 degrees, and I never felt too hot. Sure, the lines get long. Especially for the SF trucks, but if you divide and conquer its not so bad. My husband and I split up when we got there and he got Swabbies fish tacos while I got a roll from We Sushi. We ate the tacos while waiting for the sushi, then shared the roll with a couple of beers. Afterwards, we were ready to wait on the Koja Kitchen line. It was really long but we had our food within an hour, and it was worth the wait.

Even getting a snow cone took 15 minutes!  Parking wasn't too bad considering the number of people, we managed to get a spot a few blocks away.

The trucks, massive crowd, and heat all insulated by the freeway made it freakin' hot. And the crowds, oh boy was there crowds. I was pleased to see Sac events like this are picking up some momentum, but the lines to get one's food were long and took forever and a day. Had me some delectable garlic noodles and a very sweet waffle. Not a combo I would usually try, but the day called for a little wackiness. The parking situation at 2 was actually surprisingly good.

Nash & Proper,"Sacramento, CA",10/29/2018,3,"I felt that this truck was way over hyped. Everyone has been talking about it, the yelp reviews are stellar...obviously the people want fried chicken and there isn't that many places to get it in Sac.<br>That being said, my first experience at N&amp;P will most likely be my last.<br><br>First off, I don't like thigh meat, especially for a sandwhich, so I didn't get the Sammich. My husband did and he said he liked that it was thigh meat and he enjoyed his sandwich but said it was nothing to write home about.<br>I got the tenders, medium hot. They were spicy, but not too bad. 3 pretty small tenders (about index finger sized but slightly thicker) came over two slices of toasted white bread with three pickles on top. $11, I paid 50 cents extra to get a tiny condiment cup half-full of ranch dressing. I wasn't happy about this.<br><br>The tenders were fine, but way too small and mostly breading with very little chicken inside. The flavor was pretty decent. Again, they didn't come with ranch. I didn't eat the bread, I tried a  bite and it tasted like wonder bread. I tried a pickle, they were disgusting. Think school lunch program pickles, they come in a giant jug of like 1 gallon for $5. My husband and I both got a side of potato salad, again very small for the price and it was nothing special, and was too vinegary for my taste. <br><br>Our bill came out to $32 and we went home hungry. Serving sizes were too small for the price, and the quality of the food. The guy working the window didn't smile or answer when I asked how he was doing before placing my order, just stood there looking down. He never looked at me or said anything other than ""50-cents"" when I asked if ranch came with the tenders.

Nash & Proper,"Downtown, Sacramento, CA",11/4/2018,4,"The service is 5 stars! But this review is about the chicken. Let me start off by saying that I just got back from Nashville not too long ago, so I'm going into this review by comparing it to Hattie B's. And having said that, I will say that this place is probably as close to Hattie's as I've had in Sac. Yet, it doesn't really hold a candle to Hattie's. <br><br>I was with a buddy and we each got 3 tenders, one medium and one cluckin hot. Now, if you like heat, then the cluckin is for you. It's pretty damn hot, but not unbearable. When I go back, I'll probably go with it again. The medium was a really good spice too, but I'd say the equivalent of Hattie B's hot would be this places cluckin hot. <br><br>Onto the chicken, the tenders were good. They were pretty deep fried whereas Hattie's has a lot less breading. You gotta nite through a lot of fried breading to get to the chicken here and when you do, the chicken is hot and perfectly cooked, it's just really overshadowed by the breading. <br><br>I'll probably go back if I'm in the mood for some hot chicken, and I want to try the sandwich too, but if you're going here expecting Hattie B's, you will be let down (but not by much!)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6ehP6a2d02ZNIhXD39dpAg
Nash & Proper,"Elk Grove, CA",11/6/2018,5,"I've been to Nashville, and I've had the Hot Chicken at Hattie B's. I can say that there's only been one other place that did justice to Hot Chicken, and that's Howlin' Ray's in L.A.  Of all the places in Sacramento, nothing has even come close to doing justice to this dish.  Don't get me wrong; there are many excellent restaurants (South, Pangaea, etc.) which serve a tasty spicy chicken sandwich, but it's not quite Hot Chicken.  That being said, Nash and Proper is the closest I've seen, and by far one of the most enjoyable and tastiest experiences.<br><br>The Sammich: 9/10.  I ordered this at their spiciest level: Cluckin' Hot.  This would be comparable to a ""Medium"" at Howlin' Ray's/Hattie B's, possibly even a tad milder.  I would love to see more spicier options!  The thigh is a nice touch, as it has way more flavor and is juicier than breast meat.  The cole slaw, bun, and fuego sauce go really well together, and the sandwich in its entirety is quite enjoyable.<br><br>Quarter Bird: 9/10.  I'm so used to eating around the bone, and I have to say that it's quite a pleasant surprise to just eat a mouthful of chicken without worrying about it.  The bread is used to sop up the oil, and the pickles are provide a nice contrast in flavor.  I can also taste a hint of pickle brine in the chicken.<br><br>Wings: 8/10.  The wings are huge.  You get an entire drumette and wing, and the order comes with three wings.  My wings happened to be a little dry, but I'm willing to give it another try.<br><br>Overall, it's definitely worth the trip.  I hope that one day, N&amp;P will offer even spicier options!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=5otjbT9Iss5tdlBoaSLkPA

I got it medium spicy and that was the right amount of heat for me. The chicken was hot, crispy, and juicy. The mayo and pickles complimented the deep fried ness of the chicken well. The bun was soft and buttery. There was grease all over my hands afterwards but it was all worth it. The fries were ok.

Luckily there was only a couple people ahead of me, barely a line! And I've seen their Instagram videos, their lines are huge and they sometimes sell out! I got the Sammich (2 big a** boneless thighs, coleslaw, pickles and fuego sauce). Their chicken is just amazing it looks crispy and it is when you bite down and the inside is the perfect moist, easy tearing apart chicken I've had! I got mild heat and I honestly can't handle spicy... so I'm usually a mild or zest girl and their mild was another level. I would do no heat next time, I know I'm weak... lol.

Nash & Proper,"Sacramento, CA",10/18/2018,3,"I'll break this review down into three parts:<br><br>The quarter chicken was medium spicy. It had a nice heat level not overpowering and mouth-burning but made you take notice. Same for the nuggets. Both served on a bed of white bread. Both the chicken and nuggets had a thick dense crust of spicy coating. Not greasy. The primary flavor you get is salty, spicy then a finish of a bit of sage. The chicken wasn't ""moist"" but not bone dry either. IMO it could have used a sauce of some kind something a little sweet with some tang. Possibly even a twist of lemon would have been nice. It was on the verge of too salty but not bad. Overall the food was decent/good but not great.<br><br>The slaw had a light, non-mayo dressing which was more like a <br>vinegary-sweetish dressing it was good, just needed a touch more salt. The potato salad had good flavor and nice crunch from the pickles and possibly from bits of celery(?). It was really good. (it was the star of the meal)<br><br>Quantity of food: The quarter chicken was generous could possibly feed two smaller appetites but should be plenty for most people. The chicken nuggets were a decent amount as well. Judging by the photos of other reviews, the other items are probably comparably sized. We got one each of the cole slaw and the potato salad. About 8 oz. serving- a good portion.<br><br>Value: The nuggets and quarter chix were $10 ea., the slaw and salad were $3 ea. For $26 you got a good-sized, good meal. <br><br>I'd try them again, next time I'd be tempted to get the ""naked"" version which isn't spicy, and bring my own sriracha or Franks Hot Sauce, or maybe even a good BBQ sauce.

Didn't really taste the colesaw to balance it out, nonetheless, it is a big sandwich with fried chicken hanging out the bun. Their fries was soggy but the bread winner is the chicken. Although, I do enjoy Howlin' Rays better, for Sacramento, its not too shabby. Only con I can think of is that it was a tad bit on the greasy side. Their menu is almost identical, they got the sandwiches but they also have wings, thighs on bread, etc. Pickles and extra pickles is a must for me. Next time I will try the sides and see if that balances out the meal. For me its a solid 3.5 stars, 4-4.5 if it wasn't so greasy, if the buns had a better toast to prevent soggy buns.

As mentioned in other comments, it is very greasy. However, it seems that you'll always get a decent burger regardless of going on different visits. The fries are something you have to order on the side. Those were decent too and came out super hot, which was perfect for me. I had previously tried the chili cheese fries and those were really good! The shakes are pretty good too. I've tried vanilla and mint. Nothing out of this world but good if you want something sweet. <br>The staff is friendly, especially a younger looking guy (early 20's). I didn't appreciate that while he was taking my order, a (obviously older than him) female ask him, ""Are you going to ask her to move?"" I was sitting at a bigger table waiting for my guest to arrive and a big party came in. I had no problem moving what-so-ever; it made sense. But I did not appreciate her interrupting him while taking my order and acting as though I wasn't even present. I then felt uncomfortable even continuing to place my order and it was very noticeable that it was awkward for him too. <br>I doubt I'll go back to this place after that but it's worth a try if you've never been before.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7eYdEjfpO_-Fd3aZZHcjmA

I really love the family friendliness of it. We had our 13 month old with us and all he wanted to do was just run around and explore everything and anything. On multiple occasions he would rush up to another group playing lawn bowling or oversized Connect Four. When he would grab at something they would just smile. Never once did I get a dirty look or anything. That was such a relief. <br><br>When we were there, they were quite busy but it never felt cramped. The outdoor area is spacious enough and open enough that no matter where you were you didn't feel like there were large groups were around you or that it was overly loud. <br><br>They don't have food, per say, but they do offer a schedule of food trucks that are on hand to offer you eats. But with a single food truck on hand &amp; possible large groups of people, wait times for food can be long.

SacYard Community Tap House,"Eastvale, CA",3/12/2018,5,"Not a brewery but a Taphouse. It has the brewery vibe and pub feel. Located in east sactown you will find this great drinking spot which was an old truck yard. They do not have their own beer but carry a plethora of the west coast's finest that stretches from San Diego to Washington with a few local brews in the mix. <br><br>Plenty of space inside and out. TVs, music, games, kid friendly, dog friendly. I'm surprised there weren't any pet goats or pirates with parrots. They have different food trucks. Check their page before you go. <br><br>Beers are served by the true pint. They make sure you get your 16oz worth. No flights available but they will let you taste pretty much anything you want. Friendly staff and lots of cool people around. I made some new friends there and we took off and hit another spot after drinking here. <br><br>This place is probably even more awesome when the weather is cooperating. Outside looks like the perfect place to chill. Yes, it's a hike from midtown or downtown. $12-15 will get you here by rideshare. <br><br>Get out and give them a try before the word gets out.

SacYard Community Tap House,"Santa Rosa, CA",8/14/2018,5,"This is a fun beer garden with lots of upside and a little room for improvement.<br><br>The SacYard beer garden kind of has an open feel to it.  Many of the doors are wide open or glass.  When I went it was on a Friday around happy hour time, which means parking was a big issue.  I expect that anytime during peak hours there will be big parking issues, although that is probably not something the beer garden has much control over.  The interior looks very cool with a exposed rustic looking wood beams. The bathrooms were clean and the hand wash station was in between both male and female restrooms, which was a creative touch.<br><br>When I walked up to the bar it did not take long to get my beer, even though the bar area was packed.  In lots bars that serve cocktails the wait to get your drink can be very long.  Fortunately, here it is just beer and the waits are usually short. The bartender made a mistake and accidently gave me an extra beer, so no complaints there. There was also a food truck just outside, which was a good touch. <br><br>The selection of beer good and the prices are very reasonable.  It's only $6/$7 per pint.  Most of the beers appeared to be local Northern California beers.  The outside area is the best part with some areas of improvement.  There are benches, high tables, water misters for the heat and a bocce ball court. Even though the outside area is great, I think there is room for improvement. I think they should include more vegetation, grass or trees to break up the dry feel.  There could also be more benches.   <br><br>Overall, I am glad SacYard is here. They have a good thing going and shouldn't rest and keep improving. I'll be coming back.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZJbr_8S5Is2Lr8eMR2pGkQ
SacYard Community Tap House,"Sacramento, CA",1/24/2018,5,"My 107th Grand Opening review!<br><br>Well, there's a new brewery business that is coming to East Sacramento neighborhood and I just found out after I read an article thru Sacramento Business Journal this afternoon. This business called, ""Sac Yard Community Tap House"" serves the customers of 21+ to slurp their extensive library of hand-crafted beers from Sacramento to portions of California and Oregon combined! The atmosphere is very laid back and perfectly active as I welcomed there. The concept is much like visiting to your local brewery across the U.S. although for Sac Yard is pretty much simple filled with wooden furniture and industrial modern designs both inside and outside.<br><br>The employees from bartenders and servers especially cookers (if available) are doing a fantastic job for making the customers like me a splendid and unbelievable service! No cons!<br><br>So how does it works? Inside, they have nearly 25 taps available, so you can choose and try various of beers no matter if you're staying local or trying something new outside of the city. As I came here today on 1/24/2018, I ordered a pint sized of Fort Rock - Folsom Dam Good Pilsner and as I drank it, that beer tasted sensational! It has a good hoppy taste thanks to a lighter aromas and a perfect balance of flavors. Quite a good beer.<br><br>In some occasions, this place has a good amount of food trucks available, so I hope they will appear in the near future especially their mini short appearances on their favorite local grocery stores like Corti Brothers for instance.<br><br>Parking at Sac Yard can be quite challenging to park. You can park at a nearby surface street parking nor their smallest parking lot of its available. Alternatively, you can ride a bike, walk, carpool, ride sharing or public transportation easier without the hassles and gimmicks.<br><br>To conclude, the Sac Yard Community Tap House is the most incredible and friendly local library brewery tap house that I've ever discovered and visited for the first time! Perfect for friends and co-workers gathering! A well received visit &amp; planning to come back for more! My rating: 5 solid stars.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3HSmHE-FQZ7b2kyfa1e64A

Lots of benches, several fire pits, great for large parties or smaller groups, and both indoor and outdoor areas. <br><br>The People:<br>The owners (Dan and Melody,) are the kind of people that invited everyone who made their tap house dream happen to their opening evening where they stood on tables in the front of the room and personally thanked each individual or team that was present.

SacYard Community Tap House,"Oakland, CA",4/14/2018,3,"Such a beautiful venue, with a decent selection of brews on tap and a modestly priced food menu, but, alas, it has to be spoiled by subpar service. <br><br>I rolled into the bar on a Saturday night when the venue was only half full, and was greeted pleasantly enough by a female server who said she'd get to me right away, only to shoot the s**t for an extended period with another customer at the bar who was taking her royal time dithering over an order. <br><br>Then, a ponytailed dude (Ethan) came up to the bar after busing the venue, worked up in quite a rage over the fact that customers were drinking their beer out of straws. If I saw beer drinkers like that in action, I might do a double take as a beer fanatic, but I also wouldn't judge. <br><br>Ethan then carried over his piss-poor attitude towards addressing me condescendingly at the counter. I asked if they served flights, to which Ethan responded with an exceptionally angry and rude put-down: ""no, we don't do that because we're not a brewery."" <br><br>Well, ok, thanks for the attitude. Not willing to bow down to someone who was on a privileged power trip, I asked if they served smaller pours, to which I got a majorly annoyed response that yes, indeed, they serve half-pints.   Perhaps if they posted this clearly at the bar, then insufferable types like Ethan wouldn't have to answer questions from lowly peeps like me. Never mind the fact that, in a service business, good attitude, good service, and working *with* customers, instead of against them, ought to count for something. <br><br>Fortunately, on that note, Sasha, who I believe was the manager, was amazingly engaging and pleasant the next time I came to the bar, cheerfully overriding the system (which she admitted wasn't set up to handle half-pours) to fulfill my requests. Now *that's* some customer service Ethan can learn from. <br><br>Oh, and as for the beer, there are 2 dozen well-curated ones on tap at any given time. If you like to try lots of different varieties at once, like I do, they rotate frequently too. So if you stop by, avoid the stuck-up, furrowed-browed dude and go straight to Sasha the manager.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bQCHF5rn5lMI9c5kEwCaNA
SacYard Community Tap House,"Sacramento, CA",3/27/2018,5,"SacYard and Sac City are two brand new tap houses that popped on the scene at almost the same time, and it's hard to visit one without comparing it to the other. Whatever the differences in atmosphere, they are both great and SacYard would have a lot to offer either way. I'm happy to see this place pop up in an unlikely neck of our neighborhood. <br><br>The concept is simple. On the most basic level, it's a big space that serves other people's beers. That may not sound exciting on a basic level, but I assure you it's an ingenious concept. No in-house brewery to run up costs, no kitchen to run (food is available via food trucks). <br><br>The space itself is pretty cool. A spacious indoor with a big bar and an outdoor with room for dogs and children if you have them in tow. I imagine it could get pretty toasty here in the summer so let's hope they have ample shade! In the winter, however, the outdoor fire place was mighty nice. <br><br>And not to bury the headline - the beer is terrific! An excellent and diverse rotating tap of breweries big and small. Belly up and enjoy.<br><br>I just have one suggestion for these guys: work with the city to get some lighting on that street. It's damn dark there at night and probably not the safest for people to be walking intoxicated.

Before it came out, I actually had to use the restroom and found out that I had to go out of the restaurant and around the corner to do so which is always annoying! <br>The service was 1/2 service. You get a small coke and they bring it to you, then you have to keep getting up to refill it. I also asked for a wifi password for the place as they have 3 visible networks that I could see from my cell phone. They told me that if I have an xfinity account, I could use that. But if not they couldn't do anything for me.<br>Well the burger came out about 10-15 min after ordering it and as fantastic as it looked... It was way too oily. The meat didn't taste all that great either. It tasted like it was a defrosted patty. All of the condiments were  on the side by special request but there was nothing really special that I saw about the burger its self! <br>I'm actually regretting eating here now as I have a really bad stomach ache. Probably from all of the oil in the cheese! Someone will be taking a trip to the gym the gym after that adventure!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=daqVIsrcbGYi4nzqyRnT2Q

Wow! <br><br>I had previously heard of the Squeeze Inn on talk radio. They would either talk about the awesome cheese burgers or the ADA harassment at the original tiny building. Once they made it in network TV, I knew I wanted to go. It's been a few years, but I finally made it!<br><br>Now I can say the fries are classic and golden brown. The squeeze burger is 1/3 lb and filling. The cheese is huge and greasy! Red and white onions. I opted for bacon and it was fine. The next time I go and can share, I figure a ""smaller"" burger is enough and just get one order with the cheese.

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",11/5/2014,5,"I was stoked when I heard they opened a Squeeze Inn in midtown. I'd say the burgers are pretty consistent between the midtown and Power Inn locations. <br><br>FOOD: Squeeze burger with cheese. Amazing. Always. Cooked to juicy perfection, dripping with grease. And the fried cheese is always the best part. <br><br>SERVICE: Super rad! Two people in our group were sharing a burger, and without us asking, she offered to have the burger split in half. Little things like that I think are fantastic. <br><br>ATMOSPHERE: Burger... joint-y? Clean and pretty standard. Small like everything else in midtown. <br><br>PRICE: Standard for better burgers (about $8 for a squeeze burger with cheese, no sides or drink). Worth it every now and then.

Squeeze Burger,"Kingston, WA",,5,"So we were in the mood for a smoothie, weren't sure where to go. We decided to let our intuition lead the way, before you know it we found ourselves here. Funny because the name made me think twice: Squeeze Inn. Are they a restaurant or accommodations Inn? My curiosity got the best of me, and we came in for a closer look. What we found was the coolest, most delicious diner spot around town!!! We only ordered a hot dog but Omg! It was so good! I felt like I was on a carnival ride eating it. So many textures and full flavors mixing together in perfect harmony. So fun and delicious!!!Can't wait to come back to try their burgers! And their milkshake were so good!!!

But sometimes its hard to figure out which ones i should get food from. so how does this truck stand out from the rest?  <br>     When you first see the food truck, hefty gyros, you are automatically drawn to it. first off, there truck is a bright ""fire engine red"" color with contrasting bright pictures that are very clear and help you get a sense of fresh mouthwatering food before you have even order. The prices are also in a nice bold font so you can easily get a sense of what you are paying and compare prices before you get up to order. And the prices are very reasonable, much cheaper than many other gyro places i have been to, and cheaper than most other food trucks. When you get up to the truck to order you are immediately greeted by there friendly staff. If you have any questions about the food they are very helpful about explaining things, and helping you choose the best dish for your specific taste. I have actually tried every item on there menu... I love them all. When you receive your order... your once again greeted with a smile... and treated to a freshly made plate of food (or gyro) that is also i great size portion for the cheap price you pay. The sauce they use in the gyros is really great and just adds the right touch of added flavor and spice. I also love the lamb and rice plate. You get a really good portion of lamb to go with your rice and salad. If you like french fries, theres are delicious. thy add a really good seasoning to the fries as well as the same sauce used in the gyros. <br><br>I would highly recommend eating here if you are in the market for some really fresh and delicious food, as well as some great customer service.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Gar9SOdu9OEebuT0ZjsdHA

Hefty Gyros,"Roseville, CA",3/21/2016,5,"Found this food truck during my lunch at work - saw reviews on yelp and heard nothing but great things!  To believe EVERY review for any food establishment without your own research isn't ideal - but this place is an exception.<br><br>This review is based specifically on the Hefty Fries (but I'm sure all their food is great) and the overall courtesy the people inside the truck demonstrated.  <br><br>Firstly, if you order the Hefty Fries, there will be a slightly longer wait than ordering a Gyro, but IT'S WORTH IT.  This isn't to discourage others from trying it, but to prevent people from giving H.G. bad marks for waiting.  The Hefty Fries taste like they take longer to make - the fries were cripsy (seasoned with additional spices outside of the red and white sauce drizzled on top), the meat was crispy, and the portion size is big.  The sauce topping and spices on the fries are SLIGHTLY spicy but for those with low tolerance to hot flavoring, this is JUST enough heat.  And for $10?  The portion matches the price.  If you do choose to order the Hefty Fries, I suggest taking a stroll around the block to alleviate the food coma you may get if you don't.  The one contructive suggestion I would make is to change the container of the Hefty Fries - it comes in an open tin but no lid!  Unless you have a place to put the leftovers, the rest of the uneaten food is exposed to the elements.  Maybe put the Hefty Fries in one of the styrofoam lid containers?   <br><br>Now, onto my experience.  After ordering, I waited about 15mins or so?  During this time, I was reasurred about 3 times from the gentleman who took my order that my meal would be up soon.  This kind gesture, though not expected, was greatly appreciated.  Especially during lunch time, I expect to wait - it's nothing new.  So thank you, Hefty Gyros!  I hope to try your other foods on your next visit!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=KtsX9VG6Z095rZl5cN3s9A

A 2 hour wait for food is a bit ridiculous, but I can't think of an elegant, efficient method to mitigate this. (It's the engineer in me!) Perhaps taking numbers and then some LED display for the range of numbers that should be in line? That would free up people so they would try items from some of the less popular vendors. There was so much I wanted to try, but the Chairman Bao line really wore me and my friends down, so we decided we stood in line enough for one day.

I wish I tried the Inka soda but I already had another beverage from earlier. Then we went to Swabbies for fish tacos,fresh and tasty. I had to try Curry up now, an indian street food van. Very tempting selections but I picked a simple choice-chicken samosas. It was not out typical samosas. There were like 4little samosas on top a mess of garbonzo beans and spices. It was my fav of the day. Some lines were outta control and I have tried a few of those places so I didnt have to sample them. Today was over 100degrees so we only hung out about an hour.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",5/2/2011,4,"Yes, the lines were long. Yes, the weather was a bit warm for my liking. However, Sactomofo was a great way to get the word out about the diversity of Mobile Food trucks in the Sacramento area and elsewhere. I arrived around 11:30, when there were no lines and some trucks were already serving food. So, I was able to taste a tamale and a piece of pizza before the lines started forming around noon. The upsetting/annoying part of the day was the fact that some food trucks ran out of food about an hour or so after the festival started. How were they expecting to last the whole day? Hmmm...To make matters worse, the health inspectors showed up and were checking the temperature of dishes (at least that's what I saw in the Curry truck). It was pretty pathetic on the city's part to shut down some of the trucks. However, they did show the city's anti Mobile Food mentality. Just another reason why this festival was needed.<br><br>There was a good article in the paper post-event as well. It's unfortunate that Mr. Paragary thinks that food trucks are hurting his business. It's pretty preposterous.

SactoMofo,"Seattle, WA",12/3/2011,4,"Haven't been to OTG in SF or the first two SactoMofos so I really don't have anything to compare this to other than other festivals/events where mobile street food is served. They layout was OK, but the SF trucks should have been grouped together and the same types of food should have been a little more spread out. I'm really sure why some of the vendors were there because they weren't serving anything and I felt bad for others that had no customers (wrong event for their truck). I did buy some fondant candy from the sweets people, but they were kind of an odd ball. How is the attendance gauged if there aren't any primary entrances? Also, it might be a little more efficient to sell food tickets for a set price like $5-7 for a sampler or the best seller for instance. I definitely think this needed to by hyped up a little more like the previous two, but I know it was sort of pulled back together at the last minute. Maybe even have a petition to sign next time so you can deliver that to the city council. I'd love to see you guys do a competition like on the Food Network - I bet that would garner a lot of media attention. Also, though not a big deal, it would have been nice to post the menu of the day so that I could figure out what all was being offered. Other than that, SM3 was a hit with me and my friends.

SacYard Community Tap House,"Sacramento, CA",5/10/2018,4,"A little advice if you're thinking about going to any tap house or brewery in and around midtown/downtown. Go to their website and check upcoming events if there have one. Why? Because it can be busy if an event is going on and if they don't have a private parking lot, street parking can be a turn off. Anyway, that was my mistake today, thinking it was Thursday and probably not too busy, I couldn't be more wrong. The ""Street Vets"" were there this evening and it seemed like everyone and their dogs were out. Luckily I found parking not too far away and only stood around for 15 minutes until a table opened up. What made matters worst was that they had a gorgeous cathedral like wood ceiling which really projected the noise and the dogs barking. So instead of relaxing with a cold one in hand, I petted dogs and tried to avoid getting my face licked while the food from the food truck sat getting cold. The good thing about all this though, is knowing that the owner supports local nonprofits. Friendly service, every staff pitched in and helped, they moved quickly, and kept tables cleaned. Also lots of beers on tap, all California beers I believe, there was wine and cider as well. I saw a food menu on the wall but not advertised probably because the food truck was outside.

Hefty Gyros,"Sacramento, CA",10/5/2015,5,"We hired Jamal and his crew of three really nice guys to feed a work event where we anticipated around three hundred attendees. Without asking for this, Jamal actually drove by in his truck a few days early and fed the 7-8 people I had working that day ""just so we knew what his food was like""! So NICE! He showed up to our event early, got set up and actually made some good suggestions about adding more garbage cans to the food area and other helpful tips. The food they cranked out was delicious - gyros, falafel and the fries with special sauce were awesome! He made a point to make sure all our guests got exactly what they wanted and were loving his food. Attendance at the event was lighter than the anticipated 300 people, so before leaving Jamal cooked up 15-20 more gyros - literally a box full - and left them on a table in case anyone got hungry later or wanted to take some home.

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",4/28/2013,3,I went yesterday to this event. There were about 20 food trucks or maybe more. The place was full of people waiting in very long lines to buy food. I really enjoyed walking around and being able to see what all the different trucks have to offer rather than just seeing them online. I was too hungry to wait for an hour for food so I decided to headed out to Chicago fire instead. I will definitely come back next time and get here earlier. The food that I was able to see while I walked around looked very mouthwatering. The other thing I noticed was that many of the food trucks had run out of food and had a sold out sign. I'm not going to lie this experience made me want to get a food truck (just maybe). There was also a live band playing and being that its underneath the freeway the heat was tolerable. Parking sucked but people were constantly leaving. I will be looking forward the next event and actually trying some food or maybe ill bump into one of the trucks in the street. I will see what comes up first. I can't give more than 3 stars because I didn't get to try any food:(,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=D9X2CF1MqhsXuZNiTpbqwQ

SactoMofo,"Sacramento, CA",5/2/2011,3,"My 3-star review is based on the overall festival and I will review the two vendors I had the opportunity to sample separately. To echo the rest of the reviewers, the sinuous lines and wait time were ungodly. But I must say, that for a park packed with half-starved folks, everyone was in good spirits and helpful to point out the back of the line. The vendors were working at a frantic pace shelling out all kinds of savory items and sweets. I was impressed with the variety of food trucks available (French, fried, gourmet ice cream, tacos, BBQ, etc.). The scent of fried goodness filled the air. The energy was great: fun, family friendly music blasting, well behaved dogs sniffing around for dropped morsels, and impromptu picnics everywhere you turn. My major complaint is that I did not find the restroom accommodations convenient; that is to say that I NEVER found the restroom! So, for what it's worth...my recommendations for next year are as follows: sell tickets for the event and encourage taking the RT/light rail (offer free ride with event pass) or better yet, forget an annual event and let's sign the petition so that these glorious food trucks are accessible for longer periods of time than just a half hour each spot.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=_0-zUJMVbz6r6pvoIAhNVw

Plus just way too many kids, which is completely bizarre to me. I will wait until they work out some of the issues. Take note from fieldworks or a couple other taphouse type places in midtown, in how they operate which seems to be better in my view. $7 for 16oz beer is fair which I like and nice to have food trucks on site is a bonus too. Just too many choices to come back here even thou I live in the neighborhood.

I got the three tacos, Korean beef, pork and jerk chicken. The pork was ok, but the beef and chicken were on point. The price is a little steep for three tacos. There was plenty of meat in them compared to other places. The jerk chicken had just enough heat to hit you and the Korean beef was tender. I would come here again if I was craving a taco.

So I decided to get the Korean BBQ torta. The display of the food was amazing but I felt like the food was overly seasoned. I would recommend going a little lighter on the seasoning and too much ginger. It didn't have the Korean BBQ taste which was disappointing. But overall it was okay for me but I am still willing to try other things on the menu.

For shame! In fact, the cheese was not even melted at all. No joke. <br><br>They were nice about offering to melt the cheese on my burger, upon request. The cook even apologized, taking full responsibility. So, I handed back the top bun (to which all the cheese was stuck) and... voilà! Melted cheese achieved.<br><br>But as a note to the Squeeze Inn truck: When you have melted cheese on a bun, present it to the customer CHEESE SIDE UP, for goodness' sake! They returned the cheesy bun to me in a paper container cheese side down. Needless to say, when it came time to assemble the burger (yes, some assembly required), all the cheese was stuck to the container... not the bun. <br><br>I was probably better off without all the cheese on my burger because this was the greasiest burger I have ever seen... hands down. If you can get past the ""Ew!"" factor of the pools of grease (&amp; maybe you grabbed some extra napkins to soak up the grease like you're eating cafeteria pizza in grade school), then the burger was tasty enough. Not ""knock your socks off,"" but definitely good enough to not waste a bite. <br><br>All in all, for the price, I'll drive to the nearest location, but I'll save myself the heartache of a sub-standard Squeeze Inn experience by staying clear of the food truck.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0_zU3vLEYozNS_wRbSQ4Uw

The burger was OK. Nothing I would rave about. The flavor of the meat was decent, possibly a tad on the salty side. <br><br>The fries continued to disappoint. I ripped open the bag (small for the $5 asking price) and opened several of the provided ketchup packets. I dont know where ""First Street Ketchup"" comes from, but it doesnt compare to in flavor to the Heinz I am used to. Luckily I have spares in my desk drawer. Overall, the fries were soggy, not crisp, barely warm, and had little flavor other than the fish oil taste, even though they obviously had been sprinkled with something.<br><br>Next time, I am going to save about $6 and go to in-n-out, way too expensive for poor quality food.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Fx04QlxhUqmFTXF4mWLFIA

The burger itself was pretty bland. The patty tasted like one that is frozen and just thrown on top of a flat top grill. There seemed to be very little seasoning or none at all.

My biggest issue with Mobile Squeeze its that it is not street food friendly. The burger does not come with any condiments on it, you have to use the packets, and you also have to load your own burger with the toppings (lettuce, tomato pickles). Being that there is no supplied are to set anything while loading your burger, you must be proficient at doing this one handed. <br>My next issue with Mobile Squeeze, is that there is no trash receptacle made available. This is not a big deal if they are near a business or park that has one readily available, but there are times where they are in areas w/o a place to put the trash. <br>Overall, I love the food, I would just choose to go to a B&amp;M location to get it.

Five minutes later my name is called and I grab my tacos plus a few napkins. The tacos were rolled up and when I unwrapped them, lo and behold, each one had a little halo of fried cheese attached to it. They rolled back into taco shape easily. Perfect finger food. I tasted the fried cheese, yum! And onion and fresh tortilla.  The chicken chunks were diced. It was like a salad in a tortilla. The hot sauce provided was necessary because otherwise it would have been like a salad without dressing. Good enough! I would prefer some other type of sauce with it next time. I also would suggest shredded chicken cause it would give the sense that the chicken was freshly made and not merely precooked and microwaved.

Maybe about 10 minutes tops.<br><br>From what I can remember, the fries were kind of soggy but it's a good thing that the toppings made up for it. The tri tip was cooked perfectly. An overdone tri-tip can cause it to be chewy and hard to eat, which was not the problem in this situation. The loaded fries also came with nacho cheese, bacon, sour cream, green onions, and jalapenos.<br><br>I wouldn't say this meal..snack is worth $10 but I guess if you're hungry, then that's what you'll do to satisfy your hunger.

Why don't they ask how you want your burger cooked? It was probably just dry because they made it well done instead of medium rare, the way all burgers should ever be cooked. Actual taste aside, this place gave me some of the worst food poisoning of my life. I know it had to be from here because it was the only thing I ate all day.

Squeeze Burger,"Denver, CO",4/10/2014,2,"My sole purpose of coming here was to experience the legendary cheese skirt. Now that I've had it, I can definitively say this was a one time experience. I suppose all things considered, it would be more accurate to give this place 2.5 stars. <br><br>The place was easy to find, had nice outdoor seating and the server was extremely nice. The layout was kind of confusing though. I lined up to order at the counter like everyone else, but once I reached the counter and said I would be dining it, I got seated at a table and waited for the same cashier to come over and take my order. She was really helpful with the ordering process but since she was also ringing other people up, I did have to get up and refill my own drink a few times.<br><br>The cheese skirt was intense. I was a mix of excited and nervous about it, as if it was a huge impending life event. While I like the concept, the makes the burger really hard to eat. Your first few bites would be purely cheese skirt since it extends so far past the bun. I chose to take off the cheese skirt and was going to put it inside my burger when I discovered a giant gooey mess of cheese already inside the burger. I awkwardly left my cheese skirt sitting off to the side since I was overwhelmed with cheese and didn't know how to best enjoy my proper portion of cheese to avoid a stomachache. The burger itself was pretty good, but pretty greasy due to the cheese. The fries were a bit bland to me - could've used a bit of salt or seasoning. All in all, burger with cheese + fries + drink + tip (since I had a ""server"") equated out to roughly $15...a bit overpriced for a greasy fried piece of cheese and a standard burger/fries but I guess you are paying for the overall experience of a cheese skirt rather than purely for the food.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=p3sTKtdZp5WriTptjd5XpA

I don't want my meal touching the table! <br><br>The place is staffed by mostly twenty something dudes. I don't trust their hygiene one bit. I'm a twenty something dude. First, looking at their cook area, they shovel an obscene amount of food onto the ground and then don't clean it up. That kitchen is disgusting. They should sweep the floors as the night goes on. It's an open plan. We see that you are gross. Second, the staff looks sloppy. Baggy, dirty pants, no apron on one guy, etc Third, dude doesn't know how to chop onions. No knife skills at all. It contributes to the theme of a bunch of sloppy dudes running a restaurant. <br><br>The burger? Well besides not wanting to eat part of the cheese skirt because it had touched the counter? Well... the meat was dry and overcooked. The bun was chewey (and greasy from covering it on the grill). Heck, even the fries were chewy. Not necessarily limp. Chewy. <br><br>The service? Friendly, but not good. Right when my burger was delivered, the napkin dispenser was taken away. Half an hour till closing and they collected them all to refill. You just handed me a burger. I needed napkins! No refills, nor any attention was given until I was done. Staff stood at my spot at the counter, backs turned to my face and had conversations.

Mano was introduced to us by our wedding planner Jenn Robirds because we wanted to have a really cool food truck, which his is soooo awesome. He came all the way to our house to do a private tasting and shared with us his amazing life story of how he turned his passion into a full time career. People at our wedding could not get enough of his pizza!!!

Flour Dust Pizza Co,"Marina, CA",11/4/2018,5,"With the wedding done and over, it's time to update my review. Flour Dust was AMAZING. Maybe I should be mad though - they totally stole my thunder, jeez! :D<br><br>All our guests can't stop telling us how much they loved the pizza, antipasto platters, and s'mores Mano and his crew whipped up. We ordered for 80 guests, but only around 65 showed up (psh, typical) and Flour Dust totally rocked it. Everyone ate themselves stuffed and happy and there were still some plates of leftovers and extras stashed away for later, which I definitely appreciated after the new husband and I finally got out of our fancy clothes and realized we'd forgotten to eat more than a few delicious bites. Honestly, nothing topped sitting out by the fire in sweats and way too much makeup, stuffing my face with cold pizza hours after the wedding was over. So, so good.<br><br>When you hire Flour Dust for your event, you get way more than just great pizza. You get an unforgettable experience. They roll up in their awesome truck, which itself works as an amazing eyecatch and decorative part of your event, and they set up their own classy-looking table, and all the food they place on it just looks freaking awesome (Almost as good as it tastes). They took my simple camping wedding and, just by their presence, cranked up the rustic, homey, yet classy vibes by 300%.<br><br>I can't recommend them enough! From start to finish, they were delightful, friendly, clear, reliable, and absolute professionals. And on top of that, I'm still craving more of their pizza and s'mores and can't wait to catch them next time I'm in the area and they're at a public event.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3hobp4TVO61r3GTf8VoSdQ

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Pollock Pines, CA",11/12/2018,4,"Wow. <br>I am not quite sure how these trucks manage to serve the freshest Maine lobster all the way out here in California but everything we tried off of the menu was fantastic. I particularly enjoyed the lobster tacos and would probably order them again the next time we see the truck at an event. My wife absolutely loves the lobster rolls and has ordered them a few times now but I just can't say no to tacos of any kind. My tacos were seriously overflowing with super fresh, delicious lobster, cabbage, pico de gallo and with a squirt of lime and some hot sauce, I was transported to a fantasy realm of happiness that I had not been to in awhile. While eating my tacos, all was right with the world. No financial woes, no job worries, car troubles or pre-holiday stress.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Central Sacramento, Sacramento, CA",10/28/2018,3,"So I found this food truck by watching a rerun on shark tank. I googled and found out they have expanded to the Sacramento area so I thought I would give them a try since all the sharks claimed it was so good. I bought the 2 rolls mentioned on the show, Maine and Connecticut, came out to be $34.20<br><br>Now this is why I give it 3 stars, I am a seafood lover and I love lobster. The rolls were very small, I do appreciate them being stuffed with lobster though. One came with a lemon the other one just as is. The customer service was great and my food came out in a few minutes. The bread on the rolls was smushed and needed to be bigger. I know it's lobster but for $16+ I expect a better presentation. They tasted ok, no seasoning and for me was average at best. <br><br>Would I go again? No for $34.20 I expect to be full and I'm still hungry because they were so small and for that money I could have gotten a feast at Red Lobster and would be in a food coma right now. It just wasn't that great to justify the cost. Definitely a huge markup and I will not be a return customer. <br><br>I love food trucks and was quite disappointed in this one. I wouldn't pay more than $12 for what I got... the hot sauce really helped on the roll without the lemon. I'm really surprised they were able to expand like this.

The good thing about maine is that you can get a wide variety of lobster rolls expensive and cheap.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",9/4/2018,5,"(Update 09/03/2018): Seems they have rightfully received plenty of press and snazzy upgrades for their business.  Yet, the food is still absolutely phenomenal.  <br><br>A simple black food truck eblazoned with a red lobster and various media outlet logos lining the top - which serve as proof for various accolades received over the years - houses one of the best lobster rolls you can get in the Sacramento Area.<br><br>A television-screen in the center serves as the digital menu where customers can contimplait what to order.  However, no matter what you decide on, it will be simply delicious.  Two types of lobster rolls, tacos, and topped tater tots are the main stars and should easily take priority.  The first visit saw my group at a local brewery where they just happened to be there.  We put in an order of the Maine Lobster Roll and Lobster Tacos.  The wait was fairly short, but worth every second.  A kindly employee shouted our name and handed me two paper food trays.  <br><br>In the first tray: the lobster roll.  Nesting in a warm, almost Texas toast-like bun sits a lightly chilled mix of meaty lobster and the slightest amount of mayo.  In the second: the tacos.  Three little flour tortillas housed a mix of lobster, pico de gallo, slaw, and a slight touch of cilantro lime sauce.  The roll was divine.  The warm, slightly buttery roll complimented the fresh lobster as the mayo provided a bit of fat without being overwhelming.  I don't like mayo in large doses, so this was simply fabulous.  The tacos where quite delicious as well; it was the fresh 'n' clean taste of lobster but mixed with a bit of a refreshing 'n' citrusy crunchy slaw.  Yet, the lobster roll was the winner that night.  So much so, that we ended up ordering the other type of lobster roll - the Conneticut Lobster Roll - during the very same visit.  Another short wait, quick shout of the name, and handed another tray with a familiar-yet-difference face.  It is still housed in its warm thick bun, but this time the lobster is warm, mixed with a touch of lemon, and given a final touch of clarified butter before leaving the window.  <br><br>Eager to dive in immediately, my teeth closed around a bite of warm, buttery, lobster-y goodness that is further complimented by just the faintest touch of lemon.  It was gone in four bites but left behind a craving of wanting to shovel even more into my mouth.  It was simply the best I've had; and I've had lobster rolls before as well at the East Coast.  Now, if I had to include a ""but"" it would be that the price can quickly add up.  But even with that ""but"" it.  Is.  Worth.  Every.  Penny.  Period.<br><br>So, if you are a fan of seafood, comfort food, or needing to finally try the traditional lobstr roll, do it.  Hunt down where Cousins will be and make sure you get there early to forgo a line that easily gets long.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Lqi_EYsb7loKyi6adpqf2g

We're in a random parking lot with nothing around us except a lot of dirt, dried grass, and maybe one winery down the road. The boyfriend and I were pretty skeptical, but I hopped out and accompanied our friend. As I got closer to the front of the truck, I saw the plethora of awards and recognitions plastered across the menu. Okay, must be legit, I thought to myself.

Heaping chunks of Maine lobster sitting atop a soft roll, drizzled with just the right amount of butter. I will say that it's definitely on the pricey side.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",4/6/2018,5,"All I'm going to say is lobster roll....service was excellent. shoutout to the worker Z. Very friendly and sweet. Provided recommendations on the most popular items and was very fast in providing the food. Had the Connecticut lobster roll which is served with butter and lemon on a New England style roll. It was very soft and melted in my mouth. Lobster portion was pretty big even though the whole item looked small. It was actually quite fulfilling. Lobster Tots are served with lime sauce and pico de Gallo. Expect to pay more on the higher end side. This is lobster you're talking about, what do you expect? Definitely worth it. There's a reason why these food products expanded into a million dollar food truck! These trucks have a specific schedule where you can find out where they'll be in the local area and at what time.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",12/11/2017,3,I was at an off-site training for work and stumbled across this food truck outside. I felt like the portion size of my meal was over-priced but it was sooo delicious!! I got the Conneticut Roll and it consists of a lobster stuffed in a hot dog bun (i feel like it was a hot dog bun bc it was soo tiny) roll which was warm and buttery. The amount of lobster that was in there wasn't enough but the quality of the food was superb. My Conneticut Lobster roll was $16.50. It did NOT come with anything. No chips. No drink. Nothing. I couldn't believe I spend almost $20 on ONE item that was something like a snack. I tried it and that was the goal. I won't get it again bc it's not worth the $$. But I encourage people to try it at least once.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kkLX47mPmgC_3AHRZwWthg
Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Placerville, CA",4/29/2018,4,"The first time I had a lobster roll from Cousins, I think the size, price, and wait in line turned me off a little bit. Everything was tasty, but it's a bit pricey, and I wasn't sure if I would or could do the wait again.  That was maybe a year and a half ago. <br><br>I follow them on FB because one day I had some serious cravings for a lobster roll. I was even willing to drive the 2-2.5 hours to Sf for one. Eventually the craving went away and I forgot about them. But recently their location post showed up and what luck! They were going to be in MY small ass town at a brewery. I was going to a birthday party and even though I made MAD food to cook over there, I knew the bd gal AND me would appreciate these rolls. <br><br>I was first in line. Rolls were still $17 each and I bought 3. A CT with a touch of mayo added for me and a CT and Maine roll because I couldn't remember what kind she preferred. The size is still kinda the same. It's pretty small. <br><br>But that taste!  The lobster is so fresh. The grilled buttery bread is so tasty and decadent. I enjoyed every bite. And my friend LOVED both her rolls. Probably 5 stars from her since she didn't pay for it. It was one of the best things I ate there and there were tons of food. <br><br>So, if you can appreciate a delicious lobster roll, and understand that this is more like an appetizer, you won't get full from this roll that will cost you $20, and you got other foods on the way or something else to supplement, then this is the food truck for you. It is for me!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9nuv3DsQJFjApI3UgHvgxQ

So here goes.<br><br>With all the rave reviews on magazines, online websites, I truly expected something better. The decor of the place is nice, plenty of parking space nearby, you don't have to walk far. There seems to be a hotel, or something like that right behind it. The restroom is behind to the side of the restaurant, so that was a slight inconvenience. The staffs are friendly and helpful though.<br><br>Food wise, this place is a heart attack waiting to happen. The whole time I watch them cook my burger, I was like, oh dear... however, I was anticipating the burger all the same. If the taste was like a bomb exploding in my mouth, then I'll gladly take that heart attack. Live to enjoy life right?<br><br>Yea, the taste leave a LOT to be desired. For around $10/person (no coupons), I expected something more. More taste, more texture, more seasoning instead of just grease and .... grease. So greasy you have to wash your hands even with all the napkins you hold your burger with. With just a cheese skirt (made out of those bad processed fake cheese) and a flavorless meat patty leaves A LOT to be desired.

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",1/5/2012,4,"My first, but definitely not last, experience with any Squeeze Inn was on Tuesday night...and what a night it was. Walking into the former Infusion Cafe, I was blown away by their layout. It looked amazing inside and it had such a welcoming feel. My friends and I walked up to the counter and were prepared to order (too used to ordering first and then sitting down). A very nice young woman led us to a table and we order right away. We were waiting for a little bit (maybe 20 minutes) but seeing the amount of people in the place, I wasn't surprised. I took some pictures of the lay out and front of the restaurant and I was really impressed with the overall look. <br><br>One we got our food, my friends and I began to devour it. The burgers were as delicious and filling as my coworkers had informed me about. The only complaint I had was that it was really greasy, which it easily solved with a fist full of napkins. I took some pictures of my burger and fries plus my friends Midtown Squeeze Steak and Cheese sandwich. Everything was delicious but her sandwich was the BOMB! The fries I had ordered seemed to be bits and pieces but I still thought they were amazing. My other friend and I agreed they were some of the best fries we have had. All in all, I paid for my friends burgers and sandwich. To me, paying $40 for two orders of fries, three drinks, two burgers and a sandwich was a steal. <br><br>I have to say the staff was amazing and they even came by to ask us if we wanted refills on our sodas. I was impressed because I've only been asked that a few times in a place like Squeeze Inn before and it definitely made a good impression. Overall, my friends and I walked out of restaurant stuffed and more than satisfied with what we had come for. <br><br>I hope that the owners look to yelp to see this but if they can, they should definitely try and stay open later in the night. I think this could easily become one of the staples of late night eats during club nights and Second Saturdays. I know my friends and I are going to come here more times then we should in a month. So much for New Year's Resolution!<br><br>Oh, and a final note to any who are scared by either the Cheese Skirts or the red meat, they do have both a cheese-less and vegetarian burger (respectively).

I had a Bacon Cheese Skirt burger and there were good amount of bacon in it. Everything was almost the same that I remembered last except for one thing: the patty was slightly dry. I remembered that eating the original Squeeze was a slobber. Not that this wasn't but, with original Squeeze burger patty's juiciness, its was more messy. My friend ordered with spam and the spam was burnt to a crisp. Their fries were mediocre but I also remember the original Squeeze having the same.<br><br>It was still good though.

For starters, they're using a Miller's all beef hot dog where many would find an easy opportunity to cut a corner. The deal is really made with the batter though. It's clear that Acosta's is using a house batter and hand dipping their corndogs onsite. The final product was perfectly fried, crispy and could be habit forming. In addition to my two corndogs, I also tried a glass of their fresh squeezed watermelon lemonade. The lemonade was also a can't fail option. <br><br>In addition, to corndogs and fresh squeezed lemonades, Acosta's has a wide assortment of flavored kettle corn, funnel cakes with choice of toppings, beef jerky and a ""chip on a stick"".  I watched as several whole potatoes were transformed into long thin spirals (chips on a stick) that that were dipped in the fryer and then loaded down with choice of seasoning. I didn't try the potatoes, but given another chance I definitely would. <br><br>Fortunately I left the event I was attending prior to finding myself back for a third corndog (believe me I could've). Acosta's is running a great business. The truck appears very clean and well put together which is critical for any food dispensary, but especially for one on wheels.

Gameday Grill,"Sacramento, CA",9/11/2013,2,"Two thumbs DOWN!!! I got the classic grilled chicken sandwich. At $8.00 I was expecting something pretty spectacular. It was a regular chicken sandwich. The bread normal. Probably bought in bulk at Costco, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, cheese.... All normal. They were fresh but not like $8 fresh. There was no sauce on the classic just dry bread. The worst part is it was small!!!! Like the same size of a chicken sandwich from Burger King (the cheap chicken sandwich from Burger King). I think they need to rethink their prices. It was a yummy sandwich for the most part but I would never pay more than $3 for it. If you want to spend $8 on lunch, go anywhere else.....at least you'll get fries and a drink for that price.  I'm guessing the good reviews are coming from friends and random millionaires that aren't taken back by their insane prices lol!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j-HhJAx4q31X9pyjHPWq1g

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",6/21/2013,3,"The food was fine, but the service was, how should I put this, awkward. The restaurant has the complete makings of a casual burger restaurant where you place an order and they call your number, but alas, it's not that at all.<br><br>You have to be seated by a worker, then someone comes and takes your order. There's a soda fountain machine right out in the open where it looks like you can just walk up and fill your soda. But nope, they do it for you. It's very confusing. I guess you have to try it to under stand what I'm talking about.<br><br>Over all the food tasted fine, it was a little expensive ($7.50 for a cheese burger) but it was good burger. I actually really like the set up of the place, especially the bar stools at the counter. The location is convenient if you're doing stuff down town because it's centrally located. But the way they handle your order just sucks.<br><br>Sometimes I want casual, sometimes I want upscale with a waiter. But I never want this weird ass hybrid.

My bf ordered a burger with pastrami and it was not all that great either. There was no flavor, and the cheese skirts were not all that! Sad to say, but it was my first and last time there.

Squeeze Burger,"Austin, TX",10/21/2012,2,"Very disappointing. I had my first and second Squeeze burgers at the original location. The burger I had at midtown yesterday was not in the same league. The original had perfectly seasoned, juicy meat, fresh veg and, of course, the greasy goodness of cheese everywhere and a fantastic bakery bun. This version was insipid, poorly seasoned, with rubbery lettuce, green/unripe tomato. The bun was super nice, but it was too little too late.<br><br>The service was friendly if not very attentive. My server was a cute blond with ink all up her right arm. When she brought the burger she said she would be right back with the fries. They never came. (Thus, no impression of their fries).<br><br>Bottom line: The owner's touch and the quality of the original Squeeze Inn has not translated to this branch of its empire. It seems that the Diners, Drive Inns and Dives piece did a lot of good for Squeeze Inn but they have let the quality slip terribly. Kinda typical for a fast growing business. Too bad.

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",11/1/2012,2,"I don't know what the big deal about this place is. I've heard people say to go to the Squeeze Inn for the ""best burger"" for quite some time and finally we went to check it out. Here's our thoughts in a nutshell:<br><br>- The fries are only OK. The oil they use to cook them leaves a bit of an aftertaste in your mouth, and it's not so different from the oil you might have from a McDonald's or Carl's Jr.<br><br>- The BBQ sauce is thin and seriously lacks any flavor or punch. I don't know if it's watered down on purpose or that's just what they have, but it tastes very generic.<br><br>- The ""cheese skirt"" is overrated. Seriously.<br><br>- The burger itself is good with fresh ingredients, but it suffers from that commercialized kind of taste. It felt like I was eating a Carl's Jr. burger but slightly elevated (though Carl's Jr. BBQ sauce is far superior.)<br><br>- The place was very clean. The service was quick. The staff was friendly. 5/5 in my book.<br><br>If you'll eat anything that is labeled as ""burger"" then this place is fine in a pinch. I prefer it over a regular fast-food joint (McDonald's, Burger King, Car's, etc.) in terms of taste. But for the cost of one burger at Squeeze Inn you can get two at a fast-food place. The price for their burgers is right up there with what you'd get from the Flaming Grill Cafe (my personal, absolute favorite go-to place) or Yardhouse and so forth. But for quality.. I would choose Five Guys or Habit Burger over Squeeze Inn every day of the week and twice on Sundays. The price here is too much for the taste and what you get.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=j27i0hGRUkmDAdWJHPFixQ

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",9/2/2016,1,"I ordered a cheeseburger with the skirt. Cashier was friendly and very helpful. While waiting for my burger which I had asked for the cheese skirt to be flipped over the patty before putting on the top bun, the cook was having difficulty doing that with his bare hands. The cashier suggested that maybe they should use a fork and a knife - he was just trying to be helpful. The cook called him over afterwards and explained something that I couldn't hear obviously reprimanding him for making the suggestion by the look on his face. I was surprised at the cook's unfriendliness. Aside from that, I expected the cheese skirt to be crispy. Instead, it was rubbery and very greasy and I was unable to eat any of this hamburger while driving. By the time I got it home it was a soggy greasy mess. The cheese skirt really intrigued me when I saw it on the Internet, but I won't be back. Truly disappointed in a pricey burger.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=B5tqH-ux0FBOfJVuDONuHw

Once we were there and had ordered we remembered the cheese skirt and got excited.<br><br>It seemed to take a long time to get the food... I'm not sure if that's because it takes a long time to melt the cheese, but it definitely wasn't because of the crowd (we were early on a Saturday and only 2 other parties in the place).  I don't think it was the service staff, either, because she was prompt with taking the order and drinks.  Probably just the grill and cook time, but it's something to remember when you have impatient and hungry kids.   <br><br>The fries came out hot - nothing special.<br><br>The double squeeze was just too much - that should have been obvious, but my husband loves burgers and loves cheese.<br><br>Unlike another reviewer, I found the veggie burger patty was actually one of the best I've ever had.  It was thin with a nice crisp on it - surprising for being buried in cheese.<br><br>Maybe, if I were to find myself in the neighborhood again, with a coupon... but definitely not worth going out of my way to get.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=kESBW57NOvm6orOox4HVhw

I can feel the flavors of authentic Thai Milk tea perfectly without adding any unwanted ingredients! Meanwhile, on 4/14/2017, two years later, I also ordered the Jasmine Green Milk tea with bobas. As I drank it, it tasted alright despite there's isn't enough jasmine flavors on my drink. Hopefully they will improve their jasmine flavors next time. Of course, the bobas on both drinks were totally eatable and chewy to eat without being too mushy and melted.

The lobster meat is by far the best quality in town. I love that they give whole chunks of lobster, and not teeny-tiny, sad minced-meat stuff like other places. The bread is soft and buttery. You must try these cold lobster rolls, i prefer the cold version... my gawd, I'm getting light-headed just thinking about it. <br><br>DO NOT ORDER THE SHRIMP TACOS (3 for $11). These are the sad mince-meat type of shrimps that belong at the Sizzler salad bar. The chopped up tomatoes in the pico de gallo were bigger than these shrimps. I'd avoid.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=96RU_e7Kn-pbDTR0yhY0Lw

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Charleston, SC",6/14/2018,4,"The idea of a lobster roll has never really done anything for me, but I realize now that's because I've never had one this good! I had a Maine lobster roll and the lobster was so fresh and simple. The roll was smaller than I expected for the price tag- like the size of a hotdog bun maybe? -but after tearing into that lobster I completely get it. I get lobster rolls!! I feel like it's a real milestone in my life. Maybe I'll mark it on my calendar so we can celebrate it each year. <br><br>They had a few other items on their menu that were enticing, like lobster tots and quesadillas, but that seemed a little too far for me.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",4/4/2016,4,"Stopped by the Cousins Maine Lobster food truck when they were in Rocklin.

The treat for 2 was just about $50.<br><br>We weren't dining (or drinking at Cante AO Vino, their current location) so we hung out at the park across the street.

We picked up our food and headed back to the car. I was disappointed at first because the rolls were pretty small. Just about 4in long and smaller than other rolls we've had.

Great for us, since there was no line and the food came out pretty quickly. I had the Maine lobster roll and it was delicious. The roll was buttered nicely and the lobster tasted very fresh. My friends got the Connecticut roll and the lobster grilled cheese; we also shared lobster tater tots. Everything tasted great. I tried a bite of the lobster grilled cheese and I liked it, but I can see that some people might think it's a little too buttery. It was a very rich flavor. The lobster tater tots were also great, but I think it would be even better if there was more topping -- we ran out of topping (salsa + lobster) quickly and had to eat the rest of the tater tots plain.<br><br>Also, the customer service was very nice. The lady who helped us with our order was pleasant and welcoming. The lobster rolls are a little pricey for their size but since they're so fresh, I felt like I got my money's worth.

Off the Grid: Crocker - CLOSED,"Sacramento, CA",7/12/2016,3,"After an intermediate success of Off the Grid: River Park few weeks ago, they are doing it again for an another location in honor for every Tuesday's unofficial weekly foodie holiday, ""Taco Tuesday."" Introducing, ""Off the Grid: Crocker!"" This secondary Sacramento food trucks spot located outside Crocker Art Museum brings the customers to taste various of local food trucks no matter if it's on the menu, or something special like tacos.<br><br>For this event, it quite the same format compared to River Park event although it does adds some spice on it to make it more delightful by adding real musicians and dancers instead of full live DJ throughout the entire event. The food trucks selections are quite small, but it does have some Sacramento's greatest food trucks around like Drewski's, The Culinerdy Cruzer, OMG! Yogurt, North Border Taco, Fuzion Eatz, etc.<br><br>This time during the first Tuesday of the weekly event on 7/12/2016, I ordered Drewski's newest special creation of ""Korean Beef Tacos (3 tacos cost $10 per plate.) As I ate it, it tasted alright for me despite the beef got drier as I expected. The flavors are on point, but I wish the shredded beef needs more moisture to make this taco more interesting and eatable to chew. Quite a good taco for sure; hopefully Drewski's needs some improvements here next time.<br><br>For the drinks, I also bought the Classic Margarita on the Rocks provided by Crocker Art Museum costing me $8 per drink, and that drink is quite amazing despite the cost. The mixture of that drink is on point mixing Vodka and natural fresh, squeeze lime. Definitely a refreshing drink.<br><br>If you want to experience it next Tuesday, try it although the parking can be challenging to park. You can park early before the event started by parking at the Crocker Park, nearest surface street parking, or parking garage too. Otherwise, you can also ride a bike, walk, or use public transportation easier without the hassles.<br><br>All in all, Off the Grid: Crocker is a fine, average weekely food trucks event that I've ever experienced it after my first visit. Perhaps I'll be back next time if there's some good taco foods at different food trucks venues around. A well experience. My rating: 3 solid stars.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3HSmHE-FQZ7b2kyfa1e64A
Off the Grid: Crocker - CLOSED,"Davis, CA",7/12/2016,4,"This place was actually a lot more fun than I expected! Especially after my mediocre experience of Off the Gird: Riverwalk. <br><br>I think what made this one more successful was partly because it was hosted in the evening rather than right in the middle of the day. The food choices were a lot tastier sounding since the temperature cooled down. <br><br>This particular night was taco-themed night! I don't think any of the trucks there really specialize in tacos because it looked like all the trucks just added on some taco options while staying true to their type of cuisine. Even though most of them were added (I think), it was so interesting to see how many twists on tacos there were! It definitely made choosing something to eat so hard because there were so many choices.<br><br>I actually didn't even end up getting a taco though. I visited the Culinerdy Cruiser and got their Sloppy Joanne, a vegetarian sloppy joe made with lentils and cauliflower. Oh wow, it was SO delicious. I was afraid it was going to be super salty and/or saturated with sauce, but they were lighter on the sauce which made the spices shine. The woman at the cash register was super sweet and came out of the food truck to explain the menu to me and another woman who was trying to figure out the menu as well.<br><br>The kindness of employees extends to everyone there too! Everyone was just having a great time. There was a live music/bar area too, which sounded so fun, and the music was loud enough to penetrate through the whole event area. <br><br>Parking wasn't really difficult, but I came early so there might not be as much parking if you came later. And of course, everything is more on the pricey side, but for a once-in-a-while fun night, I think it's pretty worth it.<br><br>I definitely want to come here again and try the dole whip/yogurt truck.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=u6OgD-eAXtGmWaJ72_m2Kw

Nothing, really.

I loved the sauces on both tacos and the quality of fish and filet mignon were noticeable. I've never seen filet prepared to look more like pulled pork before, it was tender and tasty! If you aren't into spicy, like myself, then ask for the salsa on the fish taco on the side. I'm glad I did. I also ordered a can of Pepsi here, $2, geez!<br><br>Cali Love Food Truck -- The Ahi taco board got my attention, they sold them as 3 for $9, but I asked if I could buy just one. I could for $4. Little did I know, that it was literally the size of a normal wonton turned into a small taco. Flavor was good, but lacking in size for $4.<br><br>The Culinerdy Cruzer -- We ordered the Houston Burger and it was amazing, in that cover your hands (and hopefully not your clothes) type of way that only a burger can. The sauce was in abundance, but tasty. The meat was also not lacking in girth or quality! The side salad medley of corn, beans, and veggies was a really refreshing compliment to the burger!<br><br>A note to people who attend these types of events, do be the jerks who use chairs as tables. There are plenty of people who's butt's would prefer that to cramming their asses on hard cement building steps or wherever sitting can occur. Be polite, be courteous...come on Sacramentans!<br><br>They had lovely little lovebugs dancing folklorico, but we couldn't see it because it was courtyard of the Crocker and all the seats were taken. We heard music after their performance, but I don't know if it was live or a DJ...and I just can't remember.<br><br>They theme this as Taco Tuesday, all the trucks had taco options. There was also a bar in the Crocker courtyard that was selling Margs and other beverages. We didn't investigate because we had our food in hand and couldn't carry anything else, we were on our 'find seat mission'.<br><br>We found a statue and sat beneath it. We aren't opposed to going with the flow, I just think people could be a little more courteous to others, especially when they see them looking for places to enjoy their meal too.<br><br>Overall, it was a really low key event for the first try.

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",1/3/2012,1,"I thought there'd be a flood of Yelps already for Squeeze Inn's new Midtown location, but maybe everyone's still waiting for their burgers.<br><br>I'd grown accustomed to long waits for Squeeze Inn orders even before the original location had been featured on Food Network, but now that this new location is just four short blocks from my office, I figured the close proximity would be a good tradeoff for the wait, and therefore this grand opening would be the day for me to become reacquainted with my old fave. But, alas...my buddy and I both were faced with some of the worst food service incompetence we've ever experienced anywhere. We were told to expect a 30-minute wait, but it wound up taking 55 minutes after ordering to leave with our orders.<br><br>Things looked positive at first. The place was packed, but everyone had already ordered. I was quite surprised to discover a cash register with no customers in front of it. We both ordered the Squeeze w/ Cheese plus bacon. I said hold the onions. The cashier told us it'd be a 30-minute wait. The plush sofa in the east foyer area had just become vacant, so we plopped down and lost track of time talking about the DeMarcus Cousins vs. Coach Westphal debacle. We certainly burned up a lotta time scouring our brains to think of every possible head coach replacement, all the way down to ex-Nuggets coach Jeff Bzdelik. What a raw deal he got in Denver just when they finally started getting some talent!<br><br>Soon, we realized that we'd been waiting for 45 minutes. So, we stood up and started having a look around. We didn't recognize anyone who had been there longer than us. But apparently, there was one person who'd been there longer. He was demanding a refund. My buddy asked the counter help about the status of our orders while I began to observe the kitchen staff. I couldn't believe how slow the employees behind the sandwich board were working. They couldn't possibly work any slower if they tried. The dude appeared to be pausing several seconds after loading each tomato slice onto a burger as if to be sure that it wouldn't fall off the side. He was wrapping to-go orders like he was trying to change a sleeping baby's diaper without waking him up.<br><br>After a few minutes of looking around, the staff told us that they might have let our orders go to someone else. So, they asked us to order all over again. I guess I was pretty incredulous-sounding when I said ""Dude...We can't just start over."" We're only supposed to take 30 minutes for lunch, y'know. But then, in a flash, the manager put our orders together in two minutes. If you can do that for two orders, why can't every order come out like that?<br><br>We did get a free order of fries out of it, but we still had problems with our orders which we didn't discover 'til we got back to the office. My burger still had onions. My buddy's was missing the bacon. Otherwise, the quality is what we'd expected based on past experiences at the original location.<br><br>They gotta get this figured out.

It took our food a long time to get to us and this character was just chilling and running his mouth.<br><br>Waitress was the blonde chick with tattoos. I saw other reviews that she wasn't the most friendly but she was pretty attentive and a good waitress for us on this day which is the only reason I am rating with two stars instead of one.<br><br>I love to visit all types of restaurants and I am not a picky eater BUT I really don't know what the hype is all about.....$11.75 for a small cheeseburger, small fries and a drink AND slow service?

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",1/9/2012,1,"I just don't get why people get so crazy over the Squeeze Inn.  I went at lunch time with some co-workers on the third day they were opened and after waiting 15 min. to place our order, they told us it would take at least an hour for us to get our food.  So we left.<br><br>I then went this past Sunday and got there 5 min before they opened.  So they were not very crowded and I did not have to wait long at all for my food.  I take my burgers seriously and  I was VERY disappointed with the food.  The fries were all very soggy (I'm guessing that the oil was not hot enough when they fried them). The burger was a disappointment as well.  The ""cheese skirt"" was so big and greasy that it made it almost impossible to eat the burger.  So I tore off the cheese skirt, but while I was doing this all the pickles, onions, and tomatoes fell out and made a big mess of my burger.  Besides being a big greasy mess, $12.75 is a lot of money to pay for a cheese burger, fries and a coke. The burger and bun seemed to be pretty good though.<br><br>I think one can get a better burger at The Buckhorn Grill or at Burgers and Brew and pay a few dollars less.  I guess everybody likes the Squeeze Inn based on its hyped up reputation.  I will NEVER go back.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jqSkZocnCFAmWsxgv0BYRg
Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",7/26/2012,2,"I should start off by saying I didn't order the burger.  With that said, some may take this review with a grain of salt.<br><br>I ordered the taco and a side of fries.  The reason for this being that I wanted to satisfy my curiosity and experience this cheese skirt that I had heard everyone talk about for years, but I didn't want to commit myself to an entire burger.  The taco itself tasted okay, but it was dripping with meat water and oil.  The cheese skirt dominated the entire taco so I had to rip some off and put it aside.  When I got around to eating the cheese skirt, I'll admit it tasted good but it made me feel so sick that there was no way I could eat much more of it.  I love cheese, and this really surprised me.  My body just seemed to reject the food, knowing it was a heartache waiting to happen.  Thank goodness the fries were good, otherwise I wouldn't have had much to eat for lunch.<br><br>I also like that they have an outdoor seating area.  I love watching those kooky midtowners run amuck.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Bf1NSSCBTkABbr0XJzUlpw

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",1/25/2012,5,"Short version: Fabulous Squeeze Inn food, fair Squeeze Inn prices, at a more spacious and convenient location, and with even friendlier staff than the original.<br><br>Longer, more meandering version: 7 of us came in for burgers at noon. We knew there'd be a wait.  But, while we were waiting, counter staff walked around refilling drinks, and being generally helpful. (Also, by the time we left at 1:10pm, the place was pretty empty - come late if you can). <br><br>We have had some misadventures in burger enthusiasm. For some reason, many midtown restaurants find it very difficult to serve a party 7-10 burgers at roughly the same time, at the same table. No such problems here. We all got exactly the food we individually ordered, at exactly the same time, and everything was hot, including the fries. The table are equipped with ketchup, mustard, salt, and Tapatio - so we were all set. <br><br>This operation was well-executed, beginning with the ordering. We each ordered and paid separately, but the counter gal wrote them all on the same ticket (which she explained she was going to do). So, while we each paid at the counter for individual lunches, it was all cooked and delivered at the same time. It's a small thing, but it makes a huge difference. In a starkly contrasting example, Thir13en couldn't keep the orders straight between the ordering time and the 50 minutes it took them to get our food (all cheeseburgers - 9 of us) out. <br><br>This will be my new Squeeze location for sure.

Joseph the proprietor comes across as a professional chef, dressed in whites and very well informed about his food and ingredients. He offered me a special of 4 asada tacos for 6 dollars instead of 8 and he threw in 2 of his fusion tacos (pork, sweet asian slaw on a double tortilla) for free.<br><br>The Carne Asada was well marinated and tasty. Additionally the tacos come with a spicy salsa blend which is pre-applied so you aren't fooling around with containers and condiment buckets on the side of the truck.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",3/20/2016,4,"We were waiting for the Cousins Maine Lobster truck to come back around Sacramento, and when it was scheduled to be at New Helvetia , we had to block off some time to try it out. We trudged down on this rainy Sunday afternoon and got in line to try their stuff. This was going to be a tough comparison as we have tried lobster rolls in Quincy Market in Boston, Lobster Me in Las Vegas, Old Port Lobster Shack in Redwood City, and New England Lobster Co in Burlingame. <br><br>We ordered the Connecticut Lobster Roll, served warm with butter and lemon on a New England style roll ($15), The Maine Lobster Roll , served with a touch of mayo, also on a New England Style Roll ($15), the Lobster Tots, which were tater tots with pico di gallo and a cilantro lime sauce with warmed Maine lobster ($13), and a bowl of New England Clam Chowder ($7).<br><br>Both of the Lobster rolls were excellent, with a generous portion of lobster meat and were very tasty, really exceptional. The tater tots were OK, not really emphasizing the lobster in my opinion. It was kind of a noveIty dish, but I probably wont order this again next time. Would have rather gotten another lobster roll for the price of the tater tots $13 as opposed to the $15 for the lobster roll. The clam chowder was served very hot, had a nice flavor and a generous portion of clams. I would have preferred the chowder to be a little thicker, but that is just my preference. <br><br>All in all, a great concept, great lobster rolls, good other items and the ability to eat lobster rolls locally in Sacramento is a nice concept.

Besides, am I the only one who get leery of seafood that has to travel across a continent to my table?<br><br>For over $20, I got a cheap packaged desert cake thing that was kind of like a huge soft Oreo cookie and a teensy little sandwich. I took two bites and the sandwich was gone. <br><br>Food trucks are an anomaly to me. Not the novelty of them but the prices they get away with charging. The food isn't anything special. Often it's worse than a traditional restaurant. You don't get a waiter. you don't get service. You don't get ambiance. You don't get a plate or a table to sit. But yet the trucks still, unapologetically ask for a 10, 15, or 20% tip BEFORE they even serve your food that you have to walk up and get yourself. <br><br>I've seen these trucks around town before and they are all like this; they are overpriced and they under deliver.

I ordered the Maine lobster roll, lobster tail and my HB had the lobster tacos. I even ordered the whoopie pie.<br><br>My HB is super frugal but he's no lover of lobster like me so I was in lobsta heaven.

Wandering Boba,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",7/24/2015,4,"Wandering Boba is pretty damn good. They operate a food trailer that travels throughout the Sacramento area. The menu focuses on Filipino food, but they offer a great take on the cuisine. Yes, they also serve boba drinks as their name would imply. Being a food trailer, they do not have a fixed location, so you should check out their website to find a schedule.<br><br>Ordering is rather straightforward with a simple menu of a la carte, rice dishes, and other items. I love their Shanghai Lumpia rice plate with the awesome chicken bacon gravy. Rice with gravy is an under-appreciated dish, but this combination is awesome. The lumpia are small, but packed full of delicious filling and fried to perfection. They are covered with a tasty sauce, but still have room to hold without sticky fingers!<br><br>Seek these guys out, and you will be impressed. They are a great option in the Sacramento food truck scene.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA
Wandering Boba,"Sacramento, CA",6/23/2015,5,One of the best food trucks out there!!! Wandering boba is an amazing Filipino food truck with food from the soul and you can taste it on your first bite!! Wandering boba always comes to the Natomas food trucks in the library and it's my first stop always! <br><br>Ray is the coolest and he has a lot of energy and so cool to the costumers! He recommends food to customers and is always makes the customers feel welcome!! <br><br>My favorite dish is the popcorn chicken rice plate! It's mouthwatering deep fried chicken with amazing flavor with rice and savoring brown gravy topped with fresh green onions!<br><br>We also love the lumpia rice plate which is the same as the popcorn chicken but instead of chicken you get the fresh lumpia! <br>Tip: you can get the garlic fried rice instead of white rice if you choose!<br><br>I also love the loco moco! The lovely hamburger patty with rice and a lovely fried egg to finish it off! <br><br>My favorite food truck!!! Hands down!!!,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=NfO21X8Cx8nx3_K7f6kTDA
Wandering Boba,"Sacramento, CA",5/8/2016,3,"I had a nice dinner at Elk Grove's Food Truck Mania on a night where I had only leftovers waiting for me at home!<br>I had been curious about this truck and am glad I had a chance to try it. I ordered a veggie lumpia dinner, which included rice, a salad and a container of 'gravy' on the side.<br>The cashier was really friendly. He mentioned that they had garlic fried rice either instead or in addition to their usual rice (There was a live band playing close to the truck so I didn't hear everything he said!). If you want garlic rice, it's $1 extra. The total for my dinner, which had a generous portion, was $10.<br>I liked the flavors of everything, and the dressing on the salad was really good. The only thing about which I was a little disappointed was having ordinary veggies like corn, carrots and green beans inside veggie lumpia rather than something that stands out a bit more.<br>However, it was seasoned well, and a sauce was drizzled over each of the 4 lumpia, which gave the lumpia definition.<br>Maybe if I had used the gravy everything would have had a nice kick, but something just didn't stand out to me. I did enjoy trying this food truck finally, though, and am eager to try something else from the menu at a future food truck event.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7k93ID6mZefxXNmyATEQOw

Wandering Boba,"Woodland, CA",11/8/2017,5,"I was excited to see a food truck that sells lumpia. We ordered the meat lumpia and the veggie lumpia. Both were excellent. Also ordered boba tea - jasmine green without added flavor, with boba - was great, not too bitter (lots of places have bitter tea if you don't add the flavors). I ordered a second one. The white tiger tea was great too - not as overly sweet as straight Thai tea. The owner was very friendly and nice to talk to. The order came out fast. Everything was very clean.

Wandering Boba,"Temple City, CA",8/24/2016,4,"Wandering boba popped up on my Yelp page a couple of times before i actually tried it, part of the reason being that the food truck seems to be so far from me (located in sac).  When we finally drove out to find the food truck, we found that it was located near a park and there were plenty of seats and tables and chairs, i guess provided by the trucks for us to use.  the park was also located in a very safe area also it seemed, there were plenty of people walking their dogs and having a stroll, and plenty of children playing at the playground in the park. <br><br>along with the wandering boba truck, there were also some other food trucks, like chandos tacos, and cowtown creamery with some other trucks.  We had never tried Filipino food before so we really weren't sure what we were in for.  The menu seemed simple and organized and very easy to understand.  Instantly we decided to get a popcorn chicken rice plate with an addition of 4 lumpias on the side.  The cashier was super nice and friendly and the wait wasnt long at all.<br><br>the rice plate looked very appetizing, but it seemed small, my hub and i thought that we would have to order something extra because we thought we wouldnt have enough.  BUT for some reason it turned out to be plenty.  the lumpias were amazing?! The popcorn chicken was super moist on the inside and crispy on the outside and they gave plenty actually.  My hub also commented on the rice, he said that it seemed to have some sort of seasoning on it and that it wasnt just plain rice.  I really enjoyed the salad that also was in the rice plate, the dressing on the salad was super good, not sure what it was though.  they also gave us a little cup of dipping sauce, for the lumpia, i suppose and it was super tasty also. <br><br>we were super full at the end, Wandering Boba really was a good experience overall, especially with the location and the time of day they were opened, it was sort of like a picnic.  It was really nice also to try out some new foods that we never really had the chance to try before too.  Now we try to find lumpias in the supermarket so we can make some at home.  Im not sure if the wandering boba truck is at the same location every time, but if you yelpers would like to try some dank Filipino food then Wandering Boba is the place to go :^)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fCsLprE2W6bPPw--8TkVzg

Wandering Boba,"Woodland, CA",12/31/2015,4,"I am a huge fan of food trucks and specialty drinks.  To say I love boba drinks is a little but of an understatement.  So when this truck was brought to my attention, I hit social media (Instagram) to find out more.  As I scrolled through my feed, I saw that one of their specials were loco moco.  Now, I knew this was the day I would go pay this food truck a visit. <br><br>Food - The loco moco was delicious!  There was a generous helping of rice and macaroni salad.  The gravy wasn't too salty and savory.  The burger was well seasoned but was cooked a bit too well done for my liking.  I also kinda wish they would've added a little more gravy.   <br><br>Drinks - My go to is Thai Iced tea with large tapioca pearls (boba).  It was not too sweet and coupled with the tapioca pearls, it satisfied my dessert craving.  I also ordered the mango milk tea and sad to say that I wasn't too fond of it.  It doesn't have that fresh mango taste and almost tasted like an artificial flavoring.   <br><br>Staff - personable, gracious and great customer service.  You can tell they really care about how the food would be transported by offering extra bags, cup holders, etc. They take the time to explain each food item to anyone who is unfamiliar with their dishes.  <br><br>They have a stamp card which offers the buy 12 drinks, get one free deal.  Wandering Boba also does catering.  How cool would that be for your next event! <br><br>Its not hard to see myself wandering back to this food truck again.

Wandering Boba,"Fair Oaks, CA",,3,I thought the food tasted good I just didn't find value in it. The lumpia are ok but $8 for 4 small vegetable lumpia is not value.

They are definitely on the pricier end though.<br>- Meats: shrimp ($19), crab ($25), lobster ($28), grilled chicken ($17)<br>- Butters: original, cajun, garlic<br>- You also have the option of adding on an extra meat if you so choose.<br><br>I went with the shrimp low country boil with cajun butter, per the recommendation of the person taking my order. This turned out to be an excellent idea. The flavor of the butter was delicious-- when I was done, I ended up saving my box so that I could use the butter later for dipping bread in at home. The low country boils come with kielbasa, potatoes, corn, hush puppies, and your choice of meat. It was a good amount of food, but definitely not enough for two people to split and still be full. This is on the saltier side though-- I feel like a side of bread or fries would go really well with this.<br><br>+ Shrimp Po Boy: I was debating between the grilled shrimp sandwich ($13) and the Shrimp Po Boy ($13) and was told to go with the Po Boy, which turned out to be a great idea. I am normally not that big a fan of Po Boys, but this was surprisingly good! The shrimp was nicely battered and quite tasty. The sandwich was again, on the saltier side, but I really liked it. I just wish it wasn't $13.<br><br>+ Fried chicken sandwich: The fried chicken sandwich is tasty, but not as good as the shrimp po boy in my opinion. But I really liked the shrimp po boy so... there's that.<br><br>+ Fries: What are these fries made of? They are magical and addicting. The seasoning is delicious!<br><br>In addition to the low country boils and sandwiches, they also serve fried shrimp and chicken strip baskets, fries, and salads.<br><br>tl;dr: As with many food trucks, the prices here make my wallet cry, but the food here is good enough that I can make an exception every now and then.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=aSUmRlQxraEBVRnhpx9l9w

Big Shrimp’n Low Country Boil Truck,"Sacramento, CA",3/22/2018,3,"Spent St. Patrick's Day at Track 7 and I was so happy to see a food truck roll in. I've never had food from this truck before but was excited to try it. I got the fried chicken sandwich and hush puppies, my bf got a shrimp salad and Cajun fries. The fried chicken sandwich was okay, but the chicken appeared to just be chicken tenders on bread- not what I was expecting. Everything was okay, not great.

There are plenty of places to sit in the covered patio area as well as the uncovered seating area. Chando's also has additional parking behind the restaurant. The staff was really nice and attentive. We did not have wait long for our food even though they had just opened and the line was already becoming long.<br><br>I ordered my favorite from Chando's Tacos - fish tacos and my wife ordered carne asada tacos. Our tacos were delicious! I love that the fish is always cooked perfectly - it's never too dry.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",8/21/2018,5,"Hands down my favorite street taco place!<br><br>My favorites are the papas taco which is literally a deep fried potato taco topped with red salsa and cabbage. It is a crispy crunchy carb lovers taco dream. If you haven't tried the papas taco WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR! My second favorite is the Ensenada taco. I like their regular fish taco too! But I'm a sucker for the beer battered fish taco. They always give generous portions of the Ensenada which I am grateful for. Their consistency, fresh flavors, and reasonably priced food keeps me a loyal customer of Chando's. <br><br>At my office we also often order Chando's tacos catering too! And it never disappoints. I've noticed with most catering that the food isn't as good but not with Chando's! Their customer service is always SUPER helpful and they double-triple check to make sure your order is correct which is much appreciated. They make feeding a large group a tasty breeze. <br><br>Tip: Their lunch rush can get nuts like line around the building nuts so make sure to prepare for that.

They have outdoor only seating with some under a roof but open, no restroom for customers which sucks but you understand as this is the original location in a not so favorable area with limited space.

I ordered the first and second time A Chando's papas fries and the first time from point A Too B I noticed a lot of water at the bottom but the flavor was on point , today I got them and ate them right away only a small amount of liquid at the bottom and taste was on point again so if you order the Chando's papa fries try and eat them right away I think they boil their fries or something weird so they will build water at bottom if not consumed their or on the road .

Wandering Boba,"Los Angeles, CA",5/4/2014,2,"This truck reflects many of the problems seen in the sudden uptick of food trucks. People seem to see the successes and think, ""That doesn't look too hard! I can do it too!"" But in a way, trucks can be as competitive as brick and mortar restaurants. <br><br>The food trucks that started the mania offered novelties or street foods that many people weren't exposed to, and also passing on savings from not having rent or many employees. While nothing at Wandering Boba was priced at over $5, there was also not much at Wandering Boba worth $5. <br><br>Boba: tasted watery and ""strange"" - that's the most precise word there is for it. <br>Garlic parm fries: didn't seem like real parm or real garlic, pile of powdery stuff on lukewarm fries<br>Shanghai lumpia: fried to death, and pretty clearly from frozen (possibly supermarket). <br>Spam musubi: not the musubi sauce most people and restaurants use. not sure why this seemed like a good idea<br><br>Oh, it was also a bit slow as other reviewers have pointed out. <br><br>I wish food trucks would first ask themselves if their products/services are good enough to survive as a conventional shop before trying to cram it into a truck.

Deep fried just the way I like it. But I don't think that the gravy is necessary.<br><br>The Chicken Popcorn was not presented the same in the menu photos. It came with a mayo sauce that is different from the lumpia. The mayo tastes peppery and sweet. I cannot determine the other spices but It was a weird sauce. lol.

I've previously only had fruit cups from the flea market (also very refreshing and tasty) but ohh my jesus, this was the best...hands down. <br><br>What I ordered: <br>Pinãda - This is quite  a simple drink combo that contain sliced pineapples (my fave), gunthers pinepple freeze (yum), tajin (a must for fruit), and chimoy (I hope I spelled that right). So refreshing. I will say that I love the fact that they leave tajin and chimoy on the counter in case you'd like to add more (I love chimoy!)<br><br>Experience: <br>Mike (the owner) was honestly a super nice dude. Super helpful as far as explaining the experience and how to order (tons of options). The Frutazo stand does have ready to order drink (Pinãda, Mangonada, etc) but they also have a ""Create Your Own"" type of experience that allows for you to get real creative. So many options I wouldn't know where to start but I'm sure some people would have fun with that. <br><br>Cons: <br>Umm as far as the quality and experience I truly have zero complaints. After talking with Mike and checking out there Instagram page (@frutazo_stands), they're schedule can vary depending on local events. That can be frustrating for some but they do have a fairly consistent schedule on 921 Del Paso Ave. And final mention is that location parking is a tad tight (you basically pull off to side of road). There's plenty of space for up to 4 cars but on a busy day it could get tricky. <br><br>Wrapping It Up:<br>Its going to blow you away and you will basically walk away smiling!

But if you just want a regular fruit cup they do that also. They have a big selection of freeze flavors but I'll probably just stick to my lime and lemon. Since I discovered this truck I been going a couple times a week and plan on going many more times in the future. I recommend everyone try this! Every time I leave I always say, ""MAN I SHOULD HAVE GOTTEN TWO"" lol. The owner is also a nice friendly guy so that is a plus! Hey guys keep up the good work!

All Angle BBQ,"Sacramento, CA",6/15/2013,2,"It breaks my heart to have to give a low-star rating to one of my fave food groups: food trucks. But after having tasted the grub presented by All Angle, especially after having sampled just about every other food truck out there in Sac, my recent experience warrants a mere 2-star review.<br><br>The people were nice, which saved this review from being a 1-star like the previous two reviewers before me. But to me, food trucks are all about the food, and what I had just wasn't up to snuff. My ribs ($9) were tough and tasted like they'd been sitting a while. The mac 'n cheese ($3) was a big portion, but compared to Miz Shirley's was just okay. <br><br>Maybe they were having an off day?

Methinks not then 1 star is understated.  More like, run, do not walk, away.  Fast.<br><br>I adore food trucks and I'm lukewarm about bbq.  I'm really picky about meat temperatures and seasoning.  With All Angle, I didn't even have to get that far.  <br><br>When ordering, the cashier was confused (profoundly) about the menu's offerings and was trying to add the items in her head - round numbers, mind you- and off by several dollars.  I added it up for her a couple of times which only made her MORE confused.  She said well it's my first day! ....Oh honey, you have all of six items on the menu, including chips....get it together!  <br><br>Once we ordered (15 minutes, easily.  AND I don't mean IN LINE.  I mean, took 15 minutes to order, clarify and pay for ONE MEAL) the item itself - a chicken wrap (i.e., all uncooked food) with a side of mac'n'cheese took at least 20 minutes to come up.  While waiting, I pretty much determined I was taking my kid's life in his hands giving him the lunch at a sporting event. <br><br>There were three people squeezed inside this truck.  The same people intermittently handled food, and money, food and money...no handwashing OR gloves used!!!  My Mac'n'cheese was scooped out of a tub.  No idea if the tub was used to store homemade product or did they purchase it somewhere.  I watched the head chef (I'm guessing) wipe a knife he used on a sandwich on his filthy shirt...not even an apron!  Food sat out, the prep area was a disaster and all three wore FILTHY disgusting clothing.  The chef had on a shirt which was not only hanging on him, but looked like it had been pulled from a garbage bin and full of holes!  Ever heard of an apron, they work WONDERS.  I understand getting dirty in the kitchen but TRUST me this was not one day's filth.  Additionally, these three weren't moving fast enough to have created this sort of filth.<br><br>Speaking of speed....they were painfully slow.  Elderly lady slow. No, that's an insult to elderly ladies.  Snail slow.  <br><br>The food tasted...pretty much as expected given the above conditions.  We sampled the items...ate the bagged chips then threw the remains away in the best interest of our health.<br><br>Thinking of booking them at your event?  Really, don't.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=O_phUgoS_HrNPPmo8lNC9Q
All Angle BBQ,"Phoenix, AZ",7/9/2013,1,"Just 45 min after the trucks showed up they were already sold out of two featured menu items. I inferred this to mean they were popular and tasty. Unfortunately, the pulled pork sandwich I got was very disappointing.  It comes on a glorified hot dog bun but with less meat than a regular hot dog contains. There was twice as much cabbage 'n stuff as meat. The whole contents barely filled up the bun. For the same $8 I've had burritos, burgers, and other sandwiches from various food trucks that were so big I could barely finish them. After eating this sandwich I had to go somewhere else to find something for the ""rest"" of my lunch.<br><br>I did order the sandwich spicy. I like REALLY spicy food and this sandwich almost made me sweat. For me this was a big plus, but for anyone not used to that level of heat, they'd likely consider it way too spicy.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CjrbN9K4PgrhFdSMg5qZ_g
All Angle BBQ,"Rocklin, CA",11/7/2013,1,"I actually wish that I'd stuck with my homemade lunch today instead of taking the walk over to try the All Angle BBQ food truck. I get excited about the food trucks coming to the office, and I try to support them. Unfortunately, I won't visit this one again.<br><br>The menu (or lack of one) was sad. BBQ brisket or pulled pork...in a sandwich or a taco. A taco? The sides consisted of potato salad or mac &amp; cheese. And some various sodas and water. The sodas were Mexican (as evidenced by the PRODUCT OF MEXICO label on the bottle). When I left to take the trek over to the truck, I figured $12 was more than enough. Wrong. It was BARELY enough.<br><br>I opted for the pulled pork sandwich. I was asked if I wanted spicy or ""on the mild side."" I chose ""on the mild side"" because I've been surprised too many times with overly spiced food. Wong again.<br><br>For $9.00, I got a smattering of bbq pork topped with a spoonful of cole slaw on a hot dog bun (well, maybe a glorified hot dog bun). The pork tasted like it could have been a frozen product before it was heated in the truck. The sauce was very sweet and the cole slaw was pretty much tasteless. So, pretty much ""sweet"" was the only flavor. The sandwich was actually sweeter than the Mexican Sprite (it was really GOOD Sprite!).<br><br>That's $11.00 ($9 for the sandwich and $2 for the Sprite) that I'll never get back again.

All Angle BBQ,"Sacramento, CA",6/12/2013,1,"I wish I would have read this review before I went to try this truck.  The food was terrible.  Mind you, I only ordered the ribs which were so tough I couldn't even bite through the meat.  And why was a rib longer than the actual bone?  I'm sure there's some culinary term for whatever that extra meat is, but it was dry, fatty and tough.  I ordered the spicy sauce and it was SO HOT that I couldn't even finish one rib (not that I really wanted to because they sucked, but I was hungry).  They really ought to warn you that the spicy sauce is hot sauce with a bunch of chili flakes in it and not BBQ sauce kicked up a notch.  The little piece of bread they gave was stale and hard as a rock.  3 ribs for $9 bucks with no sides and stale bread??  Me thinks not.  I really love trying out the food trucks and have had some hit and misses, but I defintely, without a doubt, will not try this one again and actually recommend that you don't either.  There's no amount of curiousity that should warrant you to stand in line at this truck--oh wait, there was no line.  That should have been my first tip off.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Vt_X9QeypvDTLXyM_Y8qzw

After trying this today, all I can say that it is all angles of bad. I ordered a brisket sandwich and some macaroni salad. The macaroni salad was standard. It actually tasted like the macaroni salad from Raley's or Bel Air. I had no issues with it. The sandwich on the other hand is the reason why I decided to post this. The meat itself was slightly dry and rubbery; and the sauce was absolutely horrible. It had no flavor!

You can tell they enjoy what they do and talking to people!<br>Now, the food. I started on line where I was asked what meats I wanted. They offered beef, chicken, and pork. There was also a vegetarian/vegan option. I opted for the beef and chicken which were freshly grilled and placed on warm, soft tortilla shells. After that, there's the ""toppings bar"" where you can add items like onions, cilantro, and their variety of sauces. My favorite is the avocado one! My only complaint was that they ran out. I think they should have enough to accommodate all the guests there in the future.<br>The rice and beans is delicious - I was addicted. It went so well with the meats and sauces. It all came together so beautifully. And if that's not enough for you, there's dessert too! Churros and Horchata! The churros were great.

We were quoted for 120, with three meats and cocktail hour snacks, Carlos was quick to respond on all emails and questions I had. Everything was in place and he was really friendly!<br><br>Then my wedding happened. <br><br>First off, they requested a hose which I said we had access to (facility mess up and it was not available at the start of him cooking). This seemed to throw him off heavily as he stars being rude to people helping me set up for my wedding, even though in our emails he said he would make it work if there was not a hose. Well I'm fully dressed for my wedding and I bring the hose hook up once it's found and all is great- or so thought. <br><br>Cocktail hour food didn't even last, I had several guests not get quesadillas. Then our DJ calls up wedding party and family to get in line for dinner and Carlos started yelling at my guests to go sit back down and they'll call by tables. So I guess having a line turns him to a very disrespectful person? I don't see what the difference is if people are waiting at their tables or wait in line. This was never communicated to me beforehand and the response to my guests made him look extremely unprofessional.<br><br>By the time they packed up and were paid (and tipped well) I start hearing that a large portion of my guests didn't even get to eat because the food was gone. Carlos told me there would be enough for seconds and would leave the rest of the food for us when they leave.<br><br>My little sister said as they were packing up she saw meat left over and she had to beg them to have seconds. 3 little tacos. Which is odd to me since I had guests who said the food was gone and didn't get to eat. So my guests were being sent away as if food was gone even though it was not. And nothing was left for us like we were told.<br><br>Also- He wouldn't even let my step dad borrow a knife really quick to cut up limes for our bar and was extremely rude to him about it.<br><br>Another positive- The two helpers were super nice and had great customer service, but Carlos had an attitude problem the whole night.<br><br>My guests didn't deserve to be treated like that. I paid $1500 for guests to leave my wedding and buy themselves dinner. And the worse part is that since I was involved in my wedding and extremely busy (also drinking) I had not heard all of this, so when I was paying Carlos and asked if there was food left his response was ""yeah it's pretty much gone"". Obviously they didn't bring enough food for 120 guests that I paid for (which I didn't even have the full 120 people at the wedding).

I ordered an asada taco, a chicken taco and an asada mini torta to go. All were good. I would actually rate it more of a 3.5. I thought it was good, but nothing to write home about. I'm from San Diego and have been to many hole in the wall taco spots that I love. I would go back and try other things in the future.

Chando’s Tacos,"Vallejo, CA",10/3/2018,3,"Tried this based on yelp reviews. Place is small, long lines during lunch time. You can order ahead and they have a Pick Up Window for orders ahead to save time. Ample amount of parking, there's an overflow parking at the back. Ordered Carne Asada Nachos- kinda watery cheesy sauce: good amount of meat and toppings. 4 different tacos (fish-not a fan, shrimp-just ok, asada-good, adobada- better). Corn aka Elotes- ok except for the lime taste. Adobada Mulitas- good. Guava drink-lacking taste; a bit bland. All for $29plus. Two things I find not appealing- there was a green garbage container right at the front where you order the food by the window. FLIES, yes flies, go there and literally go inside the window (where they prepare and cook the food) when they open it to call the name of whoever's order is ready. That's unsanitary. Garbage can in front of that ordering station is not necessary. You will just order food and you have nothing to throw yet, I was wondering why is it there. It could be place on the side or where it won't be in touch with the food since the flies dig in and fly all over. And that tall, green garbage rectangular plastic container is widely open without any cover. Especially Sac weather is mostly hot, lotsa flies roam around.<br>#2 problem- FLIES again in the back dining area. Since it is open space with roof, flies tends to fly everywhere and you will be shooing all the flies as you battle while you eat. I really could not enjoy the food, I keep on waving my hands to keep the flies off my food. If the food is great but unsanitary environment and practices, it will lead to potential diseases and possibly health concerns. <br>Parking in the back can be made of smooth concrete instead of rocks. <br>Menu can be lighted and much bigger so people can see it better and clearly, instead of a small tv screen, with small fonts and not lighted area. <br>Service is nice and friendly. <br>This can be way better if the flies are out of equation! Hope they find a way to solve this problem. Flies and Great Food Never Match!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AUnIKiqDVDuyTmHPPQZk8g

Luckily, a spot opened up in the tiny parking lot. <br><br>I looked over the menu, and took note of what everyone else was ordering. I decided to go with the three taco combo. They were out of Carnitas, so I decide on Asada, Adobada, and Chicken. The Asada was grilled proper, a few crunchy edges that I really appreciated. The citrus came through as well. The chicken was juicy, and the spice/marinade combo was delicious. The star of the show, the Adobada. What a flavor bomb! The marinade penetrates deep, and the result is a deliciously spiced, juicy meaty taco that had me smiling while I devoured it. Four stars as they were out of the mini-churros that come with the combo, and for the teenagers that threw eggs at the patrons and ended up on my shoe. That's not Chando's fault, but still happened.

It has come to the point where I have to check each order and say my sour cream, I paid extra for it.

Their street tacos are a little dry, and sparse on meat and toppings, but the flavors mix well. Their burritos are much more tasty, and the Ninja burrito is a refreshing take on american-mexican mainstays, since it adds an ""asian fusion"" flavor and texture to the palate. Asian cole slaw that comes on their food gives a good contrast to the meatiness of their food. Not a terrible amount of filler beans and rice in their burritos either, so every bite is guaranteed to have enjoyable flavor.

Carlos Mejia’s Curbside Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",7/24/2016,5,Best taco caterer in sac for sure! Can't believe the amazing job you did. Thanks so much for the delicious food and wonderful customer service! You and your staff were the kindest people. Everyone from the little kids to the great grandparents there felt so happy talking to you! I heard more than a few people say they couldn't wait to have a party to be able to hire you for it!

Carlos Mejia’s Curbside Kitchen,"Davis, CA",6/12/2016,5,"I highly recommend these guys!! Had my event yesterday and had wanted a taco truck, but none were available. Actually happier it turned out this way as Carlos and his staff not only serve delicious food, but do so professionally. The nurse in me always gives a weather eye to food prep...they hooked up a sink, donned chef styled jackets...all to serve at my jinky garage grad party! They were meticulous! Now, let's talk food...awesome street style tacos (pork, beef and chicken) all the meats marinated before the day and ready to roll the evening of. Everyone I talked to had 4 or more tacos as they were so good! They also do rice, beans and churros to accompany their food. A lot of my guests took Carlos' business card to do their own gigs. Yeah, so grab 'em while you can!! Can't say enough about the guy's easy going relaxed attitude either. Are you still sitting there?

Carlos Mejia’s Curbside Kitchen,"San Francisco, CA",7/10/2016,5,"If I could give more stars I would.  Just like last poster, Ramon, I had the same experience.  If you don't grab Carlos now my guess is you won't be able to get him easily as soon as word gets out.  Food was ridiculously delicious.  Service was amazing.  I was going to do a taco truck but after researching, this option is WAY better.  Who needs a huge truck in the front of their house?  The service was amazing.  Carlos and his crew could NOT have been more polite and cheerful.  He was prompt.  Followed through on every single thing. <br><br>We had party in our yard yesterday.  11 adults and 11 children and even with his 50 person minimum it was a bargain.  I can't wait to use him again.  We host this group once every few months and the group has already agreed we want the exact same repeat as yesterday. <br><br>Not only was food great, service amazing, follow-through and communication always prompt, but he even has music if you need it.  <br><br>This ""curbside"" set-up is way better than a taco truck option.  I promise you - use Carlos and you will be ecstatic like I am right now.  This is the type of guy who you meet and just wish all the best for which is why I'm taking my time out to post this.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=xgOTh9XxYuydrpBAKF3L5w

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Placerville, CA",6/8/2017,4,"Food - 2.5 stars<br>Service - 5.0 stars<br><br>My actual rating is 4 stars because I do not like seafood pretty much at all - only exceptions are fried shrimp and crab.  I saw this truck in Roseville as I was on my way to see a client and was curious so checked out the menu and saw shrimp tacos. I asked if the shrimp was deep fried and Vicki said yes. I paid a whopping $22 (also ordered smothered tots).  Received my tacos, went to eat in my car and was very disappointed to open the package and find tiny baby shrimp, unbreaded and not fried (the kind of shrimp you'd see in a shrimp cocktail).<br><br>I went back to the truck and was very, very confused. Vicki explained that they warm them in the deep frier. I was just baffled. She seemed confused herself and suddenly realized what I meant, ""ohhh you mean like breaded, etc???"" I thought to myself well duh what else could someone possibly mean when they ask is your shrimp deep fried...!?!? She was very kind and apologetic - clearly this was just a very innocent miscommunication.<br><br>She said keep your shrimp tacos and give them to someone else, I will make you whatever you want. Confused as there literally is nothing else I want, she persuaded me to try a lobster roll at no cost. I tried it and did not like it. She also persuaded me to try the shrimp before turning my nose up at it and I have to admit I was pleasantly surprised. Not my cup of tea but it wasn't bad. Ended up eating one shrimp taco and my tots. For $22 I definitely feel ripped off, but I'm convinced it wasn't intentional. Vicki did what she could to rectify the situation.<br><br>My advice is that 99.9% of people will ALWAYS be referring to a breaded and fried tempura-type of shrimp when they ask if its deep fried. Really wish they would have offered a refund instead of making me something else when I'd already expressed I did not like lobster. STILL, with that said, its CLEARLY my own silly mistake for ordering anything from a lobster truck and I fully take responsibility for that. Lesson learned.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ncEael-FgTFTD63Y8xWXgQ

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",7/5/2015,5,"Ahoy, matey! Get yerself some chowdah and cold bottle of Maine root beer from this awesomely awesome truck dedicated to that spiny crustacean we all love and know; the lobster. Better yet, go for the lobster bisque, since this is a food truck that pays homage to everything lobster (though there are shrimp tacos, if you're so inclined). <br><br>But why would you show up to this temple to briny awesomeness and NOT get lobster? Heck, I'm not even a big lobster fan (I know, quell your shock), but it was like a crime not to order one of their delectable offerings smothered in fresh lobster.<br><br>This was all hubby's idea...he got the email from Yolo Brewing Company saying they were open on the 4th of July, and that the featured food truck was gonna be the ""made famous by being on Shark Tank"" Cousins Maine Lobster. Neither of us had tried either place, so why the heck not?!<br><br>We got to YBC around 4:30, and were happy to see that the food truck was still there, still open, and not sold out of product (which happens with food trucks sometimes). We were also happy, though I was surprised, that there was no line. Hubby ordered his beer inside at YBC, and I went to the truck, where it was explained that between the time they opened at 11am until about 4pm, there was a constant and full line going all the way back thru YBC, but we were lucky it tapered off. No argument from me on that!<br><br>Hubby had his palate set for the lobster roll ($14), which was cradled in a soft roll and PACKED with fresh chunks of lobster...no excess filler of cabbage or carrots or what have you to ruin the lobster's freshness and flavor. Hubby loved it. <br><br>I ordered the lobster tater tots ($12), which was a nice portion of tater tots COVERED in shredded lobster bits, mixed with diced tomatoes (I had fun picking those out, because y'all out there in Yelp-land know I cannot stand tomatoes) and onions. They were delicious, and filling because of the deep-fried tots. I left a LOT of that lobster for the hubby to happily finish off by the fork-full.<br><br>Hubby was still hungry, and I was still thirsty (YBC only does beer, no cider), so back to the truck I went and ordered the lobster tacos ($12) and two more bottles of Maine root beer (I'm a root beer snob, and will pay for good bottled root beer, which this elixir was). There were three tacos, packed with the lobster, tomatoes, and onions. Of course, the lobster was the star, which Hubby loved. I ate about half of one of the tacos, since I really was pretty full from the lobster tots, which meant Hubby got to indulge in 2.5 lobster tacos all to himself, about which I heard no complaints :)<br><br>Cousins Maine Lobster truck is a franchise truck deal, because obviously this truck did not drive to West Sac all the way from Maine for the 4th of July. The address on the door shows an address on Richards Blvd here in Sac, which means we'll no doubt be seeing this fab food truck making the rounds of many a SactoMoFo around here.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Elverta, CA",1/22/2018,3,"I stopped by the Cousins truck last week on Thursday and before I give my personal review I have to say, I read a lot of other's comments and the number I saw regarding the amount of(or lack of) lobster in the rolls compared to the price is just silly. The rolls are generously filled, not quite like the pictures but what place really does serve food exactly like the picture? Also, lobster is never inexpensive so I find it to be ridiculous that so many people are complaining about the $16 price. If that's too much in your opinion, you probably shouldn't order from here to begin with Just sayin! <br><br>With that being said, I did not appreciate that my roll wasn't served with a side of butter or lemon wedge as described and pictured. I also did not receive cole slaw or a pickle that I believe should have come with my roll. It was over saturated in butter and I would have preferred to have it served on the side like I expected. Over all my food was good but it did not blow me away. It was a cool experience and I don't feel like it was a waste of money however there is room for improvement for sure. <br><br>I always appreciate when owners or management reach out on Yelp and I have seen that a lot for this food truck but I think it would be so much better if very unsatisfied customers were offered another chance to come back on them, not just a comment saying ask for management next time. Again just my opinion. <br><br>If you like lobster rolls that are simple I say check this place out. I got nice, big pieces of meat on my roll.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VeMNR7xnABEyjIMxjf5PQQ

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Seattle, WA",6/21/2016,5,"Wow! I was impressed by the menu selections and prices. For the Connecticut lobster roll with warm butter and lemon on a plain roll, the $15 was well worth it. The quality of the tender lobster meat was excellent. I've spent double, sometimes even triple, at restaurants and end up with dry, chewy lobster. Cousin's Maine Lobster food truck serves better lobster than those restaurants that overcooked and overprice their lobster! <br><br>We ordered a few different items on the menu to try them out. The lobster roll was absolutely delicious, and as a seafood lover, I ordered a second roll! The lobster tots were good too, as well as the lobster bisque. The lobster tots were served with warm lobster and pick de gallo. <br><br>I'd like to see the food truck out and about more in Sacramento.

The rice was plain rice so it's rice. The chicken had too much of a strong vinegar taste.

I ordered a shanghai lumpia ala carte for 8.00 once and thought they were perfect and loved the sauced they came with. More recently I tried the daily special of Sisig which I requested with no raw onion for 9.00 and a drink of calamansi lemonade at 4.00. <br>   The sisig was very citrusy being marinated in the calamansi juice, which I found out after the nice guy at the window gave me an education of this citrus fruit originally from the Philippines. I love trying new things and especially appreciated the exuberance they have for bringing something from the Philippines to Carmichael. I look forward to trying more items from their food truck at more events in the future.

Wandering Boba,"Sacramento, CA",9/5/2015,5,"What do you do when 40+ outstanding food trucks gather for a day? Sactomofo at Discovery park is just such an event. So what do you do??? We chose to sample small bites from as many trucks as we could. Wandering Boba had by far, the smallest truck at the event. How could these Pinoy/Pinay compete out here? Lumpia is how! Understand here that I work with many good Filipino folks and have had my share of great homemade lumpia. The vegetable lumpia from Wandering Boba is without question the best I have ever had. This lumpia broke a mold that all lumpia I have had seems to follow. The vegetables were more chunky and fresh seeming than I am used to. I usually have a little vinegar dip with my lumpia but Wondering drizzled on creamy sweet chili sauce that left me with no craving for anything else. In closing, if you see this tiny little truck serving food where you are,  I cannot recommend them any higher. I will be looking for them again myself. <br>Maraming salamat Wandering Boba.

Maybe the loss of the building was a blessing in disguise since now the glory of the Squeeze can be shared by all in their new locations. <br>I like the Squeeze Inn Midtowns location since there is not something on every corner, there is enough parking. <br>As for the building itself, It could use more goofy shit on the walls, but then you have to take your eyes off the awesome hand painted floor to even look at the walls. I really like how they re-created the old Squeeze entry way and made it a booth, like they did with the Fruitridge location.<br>The food here is authentic Squeeze Inn food, but there are some variations.  They have added a cheese steak sandwich, which I was excited to try, but disappointed in the result. It was very dry and not cheesy. It was suggested that put some salsa on top, but salsa does not belong on a cheese steak. Might I make another suggestion? Rather than cheese skirting the bun, cheese skirt the meat and peppers. When the bun is skirted, it prevents the juices from the meat from soaking into the bun. Also, don't be skimpy with the cheese.

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",1/12/2012,1,"Just returned from an unfortunate experience at the new squeeze inn location in Midtown.

After waiting no joke or exaggeration....an hour for our food I had to go up and ask when it would be ready, they said we were next. After another five minutes I requested the order be switched to to-go. Probably not the best decision because the ""large"" fry that I paid $4 was not enough for 2-4 people as the menu states and was the size of the small fry given to someone who was dining at the restaurant. When we ordered we were not warned it would be an hour before we saw our food. I was expecting maybe a 20 minute wait for our food....30 tops. There were people who ordered after us that had their food before us. They should really let people know or have a sign or something not to expect your lunch to come timely.

Squeeze Burger,"Rancho Cordova, CA",5/5/2013,2,"After hearing so much about Squeeze in burgers, I finally had to give them a try. As I was in midtown anyway, I decided to give this location a whirl for my maiden voyage into cheese skirt land.<br><br>The place itself was nice, and they have several nice references to the original location which I appreciate. The staff was reasonably attentive and nice.<br><br>The whole reason I came in was to have a legendary burger experience. The first thing I noticed was the outrageous prices! $10 for a burger? If I hadn't heard so much hype about this place, I'd have left after seeing that, but I figured I should try it. Can't have built such a great reputation if the burger isn't worth it, right?<br><br>Wrong. First of all, it took almost 20 minutes to get my burger. The only reason I know it took so long was because I had to go feed the meter that I'd only put 30 mins on. I didn't think I needed longer than that for a burger!<br><br>The cheese skirt is fun, and it's a ton of fried cheese, so what can go wrong there? That being said, it does make eating the burger more challenging, and the cheese itself is run of the mill.<br><br>I guess that last phrase kind of sums up my impressions of the food. Run of the mill (if you don't count the ""innovation"" the cheese skirt). The burger itself was completely unremarkable as were all of the toppings. The fries were totally forgettable. Again, nothing was bad, but it wasn't very good, let alone something special, and it definitely was expensive. For a soda, fries and a bacon cheese burger, it was $15. <br><br>Maybe this location doesn't have that ""magic"" that the original location (or even other locations in this chain) have, but that should not be an excuse. In-n-Out has hundreds of locations, and they consistently make a far superior product (in my opinion) for half the price.<br><br>If you absolutely must have fried cheese, do yourself a favor and pick up a double double, take it home and fry up some cheese on the side.

Squeeze Burger,"Sacramento, CA",7/18/2012,3,"My boyfriend told me this place was nothing special- just an average burger with an obscene amount of cheese.

I was trying to be open-minded, but I took a bite and then ripped the rest off. Even by gluttonous standards, this was just insane to me. The biggest disappointment to me, though, was the meat itself. I mean, even if it has a cheese skirt, a burger is a burger!!! Sure, the cheese is novel, the toppings (pickle, onion, lettuce, tomato) were delicious and fresh, and the bun was perfect... but the burger meat itself was EHHHHHH.

Lobster isn't exactly the first thing that comes to mind when you think cheap and portable street food, but they've turned it into an industry. <br><br>Before I even stepped up to order, multiple friends warned me that the prices are steep. After tasting their product, I can see why. It costs a pretty penny to turn out fresh, quality lobster off a truck.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",10/27/2015,4,"After a wonderful night of beerz sampler at the twelve rounds of brewing company, i was hungry and ready  for some lobster feast! Unfortunately i wanted to keep the buzz so i picked something light but rich and creamy. Can you guest what it was?........  Lobster bisque! Yasss! Even little ms. jackie... oops its mrs. jackie! had a tiny taste of it and said it was amazing and then proceed to excitedly  shout at her husband on how they must get it! lol.... <br><br>So this is how it works, Went outside and got in line, then a friendly lady asked what i wanted so here i order the lobster bisque. The total came out to $7 something for a cup of lobster bisque, it was under $8 for sure. The soup cup is ok, not huge but a good amount. <br><br>Lobster bisque <br><br>When i opened the container, i was like where is the lobster at? I saw maybe a good 4 pieces max, not big pieces but little chunks or clumps of it. It doesn't smell fishy, but yes it tastes like seafood, so if your not a seafood or lobster lover you might not like it. It was in a creamy texture with a rich lobster flavor. The color of the soup is like a orange light pink flavor, which looks appetizing. It came with a bag of crackers and yum it complimented well with the soup. <br><br>Lobster tots! <br><br>These were amazing and scrumptious! The presentation was very well presented. So much pico de gallo or just plain tomatoes and it as extra saucy with big chunks of lobster. This ended up $12 but it was well worth it. My buddy had got this order and when he left it unattended, that was when the foodie monster came up and gobble up some hehe.... it was delicious! Just one con about this was the tots were steaming hot when i ate it, it was more on the warm side. Overall it was saucy and yes theres chunks of lobsters. <br><br>I am a fan of this food truck and will consider ordering again. It was a well worth it treat since i love lobsters. I like how everything is lobster related and is great for people who have lobster fever. Prices are on the steeper side but you get what you pay for.

The lobster roll had much more bun that meat. Same goes for the small street taco tortillas covering the measly lobster portions in the tacos. Finally, the lobster bisque was all pink cream sauce with no more than 4 morsel size chips of lobster floating in it.

Squeeze Burger,"Houston, TX",9/17/2012,3,"The fiancee LOVES cheese, so this place was a must when we heard of it. I'm not sure which location we visited, so I just picked one.<br><br>This was far from the best burger I've ever had, but it was decent and the experience was one that we don't regret. As far as regularly visiting Squeeze, I'm not sure how they can sustain that many locations on the quality of the food. <br><br>Not being fond of burned cheese, I could have done without the skirt. In fact, I found that my burger had hardly any cheese left on it at all, after I cut the skirt off. The cheese must have completely melted off the burger. It was also the smallest 1/3lb burger I've ever had. The fries, however, were up to standard for me (a fry lover, heart-and-soul). Other yelpers noted soggy fries. I happen to enjoy a basket of fries with a variety of textures, which Squeeze did well. <br><br>Squeeze encounters a disadvantage which plagues many similar restaurants...grease from ceiling-to-floor. I find myself in an internal turmoil every time I visit a place like this. I want to eat all the grease and not get a drop on me, at the same time. I don't think it's too much to ask that the burger be assembled with non-greasy hands. Granted, it's especially hard when the burgers are wearing skirts.<br><br>Thumbs up for carrying Coca-Cola products AND serving Coke Zero. That was a first! The service and timing was satisfactory.

""You can't go home again'.  This is an example!  As we live in Grass Valley we don't get down to Sacramento that often, so yesterday after going to the big  bicycle show at the Convention Center we decided to have a killer (as we remembered it) at Squeeze Inn.  What a surprise to see that they had a location within walking distance.  We got there about 11:50 AM naturally expecting a wait... which was no big deal.  About 25 mins later we were directed to a cute little booth by the front window.  We both ordered the smaller burger with cheese, one order of fries plus small sodas.  Received our order approx 20 mins later... not bad for lunch hour.  First off.... the cheese was a non-pliable ""square thing"" inside the burger.  It was really hard and I didn't know how to attack the burger... I ended up folding all four corners and put them inside.  I started to munch out but it took me about three bites before I finally reached the meat itself and it was very overcooked, dry and flavorless.<br>From my memory of our lunch at the original Squeeze Inn I recall a really juicy burger with a wonderful cheese doily  around the burger that was served directly from the grill to our front row seats.  God it was sooooo good!  What the heck happened?  Well..... I asked one of the servers if the Squeeze Inn had gone the ""franchise"" route since there are now multiple locations and he said that the new locations are individually owned with the originally owner getting a percentage.  I did wonder about all the family pictures on the walls of our booth.  OK now I get it...... next time I'll go back to the Squeeze Inn on Power Inn Road for, hopefully the best burger in town!  Maybe ""you can go home again""!!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=XBPxiwn5znOtCL1Cx7EFxQ

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",9/16/2018,1,"After seeing so many 5 star reviews and hearing enthusiastic praise from friends about this place, I finally got a chance to hit this place up on the way home from a play at the Big Idea Theatre in West Sac. I was pretty pumped about ""slumming it up"" at a veritable taco stand. Plus, I was hungry; which, as the saying goes, makes the best sauce. All points in Chando's favor. My expectations were roughly taco-stand high.<br><br>Long story short, for those who prefer the ""brass tacks"" reviews: Chando's Tacos let me down hard, I have to say. They dropped the figurative tortilla on this one. I mean, maybe it was because they were 20 minute from closing but I don't know how they could screw up some fajita onions and peppers but they did. To keep it simple, I ordered three different tacos from the vegetarian menu and a vegetarian burrito--sadly, all four items were abysmal. I make one exception here but with a caveat: the flour tortilla on the burrito could've been terrific. Unfortunately, I didn't have a chance to try it in it's grilled condition since it was so utterly soggy by the time I opened it up that the moisture from the burrito leaked all over my pants and car seat--it was a soggy mess through both wrappings and the bag itself. <br><br>On arrival, I let the cashier know that I was allergic to dairy and couldn't eat the sour cream and cheese but asked it they could be generous with the vegetables as a substitution for the missing ingredients. Everything seemed like it would be a great experience--the cashier was nice, the evening weather was just right, and I was in the mood for some simple but flavorful tacos--I ordered a burrito and 3 tacos and like I said they were totally bland--not even salted well. My burrito, in addition to being a soggy mess, had NO BEANS, no GUAC, NOTHING BUT ONIONS AND PEPPERS! WTF is that noise? So when I said no cheese and sour cream they must've heard me say, make the worst GD burrito you've ever concocted; because that's exactly what they did. Now, the worst part is the onions and peppers weren't even good. They tasted like they consisted mostly of the thin surface layers of an onion--you know the stringy part that most people throw away--several bites were so tough and chewy in a way that wouldn't break down that I had to just spit them out and put them on the side of my plate. Now, the tacos were simply sad. Too sad to even talk about here. I'm sure this place could be amazing for a certain type of person but I'll stick with Cantina Alley or Bambi Tacos.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0b-x4uyN9la5T8ym0djyvw

Chando's, why are you letting in-person orders cut in line ahead of PREPAID online orders? Why aren't your staff periodically checking the crowd to see who's arrived for pickup?

Squeeze Burger,"North Highlands, CA",9/17/2012,2,"I've been to other locations of The Squeeze Inn and enjoyed every last bit of the experiences and hate to give the newer midtown location two stars, but I can't overlook the horrible experience I had there this past weekend. <br><br>Yesterday, my fiancé and I decided to finally cash in on the two $10 gift certificates we bought for half price from the SN&amp;R Sweetdeals page awhile back. First impression walking in was mostly good; the server that greeted us was friendly, but also let me know that they don't serve milkshakes at that location yet when I asked (not her fault, but still lame on a 90+ degree day). She was also the one to take our order and bring out our drinks. I ordered the squeezeburger with cheese and avocado, with NO mustard (because I'm allergic) and no onion (preference) and my fiancé ordered the Squeezeburger with cheese and bacon with NO tomato (also because of an allergy).  The food was ready in a timely fashion (delivered by a different server) and our drinks never went dry. However, both orders were made incorrectly. A fact I noticed just a terrifying moment too late. <br><br>While waiting for the burger to cool, I tore off a piece of the cheese skirt on my burger that, unbeknownst to me, happened to have a tiny amount of mustard on it. Luckily, I hadn't swallowed the bite yet when I realized I was having an allergic reaction and immediately spit it out and proceeded to wipe the inside of my mouth out with napkins and flushed as much as I could out using small sips of my drink(again spitting into napkins). The next 5-10 minutes were spent hacking and wheezing for air as my body realized the threat was gone. In the meantime I examined my burger and realized that I was given a squeezeburger with cheese, no avocado, but lots of onion and mustard. While still coughing and wheezing into a wad of napkins I took the burger back to the main counter with the bill and said it was made incorrectly and that I was allergic to mustard. The gentleman at the counter took the burger back to the kitchen with no fuss. While all of this was going on, my fiancé decided to check his burger and realized it was also made incorrectly. He'd gotten his bacon and cheese as well as my avocado and tomato. Fortunately, his tomato allergy isn't severe and he was able to just remove the slice and proceed to eat with no problem. <br><br>When the server brought out my ""fixed"" burger, all she could say was ""oh, hahaha, I must have mixed up your order."" I restrained myself from yelling ""No sh*t Sherlock"" and instead examined my food thoroughly. Upon inspection I realized that all they did to ""fix"" my order was remove the cheese skirt from the original burger, remove the mustard ridden bottom bun and replace it with one sans mustard and onion - they didn't even use a new toothpick (I wouldn't normally notice things like this, but when the order was originally brought out, I noticed that one of the little red cellophane pieces attached to the toothpick was really long compared to the rest and waved in the steam like a flag. Random, I know, but I noticed the cellophane then and I noticed it again when it was brought out the second time). So, what I ended up with was a cold, skirtless cheeseburger that had been frankensteined together in hopes that I wouldn't have another allergic reaction.<br><br>Normally, if I had been subjected to such careless and dangerous service at a restaurant I'd ask to talk to a manager immediately. But, knowing we were paying with gift certificates obtained at half price and that I needed to get out and take some Benadryl ASAP, I sucked it up and ate around the possibly contaminated toothpick anyway. <br><br>Today, I do wish I had asked to talk to a manager while we were there. My throat still hurts from the swelling and coughing. Instead, I left a 10% tip (very bad coming from me - I spent many, many years surviving on tips hustled serving coffee, booze and food and know how hard that life can be) and a note to accompany it letting them know why the tip was so low and advising them to be careful.<br><br>I can't say I'll never, ever go back to this location, but it's definitely not high on my list of places to revisit or recommend to others.<br><br>The place wasn't that busy when we came in, so I guess the real question is: What gives Squeeze Inn Midtown?",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=mkzowQ3hGTrh0aTmO20tRw

Chando’s Tacos,"Bakersfield, CA",8/19/2018,4,"We were in town due to work and decided to try out Chandos, since people recommended them and we were In the mood for tacos.Lets start off with the good. The size of the taco is larger than you would expect at most taquerias. The chorizo and the asada were by far the better tasting of the ones we got. With the cochinita a close third. The pickled onion and habanero on top of that taco was really good. The aguas frescas selection was minimal but the ones they had were really tasteful and refreshing(we had the guava and pineapple). The bad was the wait time. It seemed that they were a little more concerned with the phone orders then the actual people waiting in line. There was a line of 5 and it took us almost 20 mins to order. Then another 15 for food but if it's fresh I don't mind the wait for the food. The eating area was a bit dirty seemed no one had  attended it for a min but it was outside so it's kinda expected. They did have a outside cooler that kept the temperature down so that's a huge plus.

Wandering Boba,"Sacramento, CA",5/8/2014,3,"I have to give these guys credit for thinking up of the idea for a food truck. Obviously,  I ordered the regular milk tea with boba. They only have regular size boba. I preferred the mini ones. The boba was on the softer side because it sits in a crockpot until the drink is ordered. The milk tea was on the weaker side. It was more watery.  Food wise, it's more expensive than other establishments plus you get less. I ordered the popcorn chicken. It needed more crispiness and for $1.50 you can get rice with gravy which was flavorful thanks to bacon.  Bacon always make things better!

The tea is ok, it was still really sweet stlll, but was really light and refreshing. I like how you can customize it and make it less sweet and I like how they are a food truck and come to me instead of me going to them, but the drink overall is ok for $4.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rNMJBxDlVSiJZUxE4ZYz0w
Wandering Boba,"Emeryville, CA",4/2/2014,5,"I'm not even one to use my account on here very much, and I am even a very self-proclaimed food snob. I'm making sure I leave this review to let you guys know this is one of the many things Sacramento has been missing. Most food trucks here have a lack of imagination, or concept. They usually do something sandwich-based, never veering far from this.<br><br>The fine folks of Wandering Boba (Ray &amp; Joanne) take the amazingness we love from a Quickly, or Boba cafe, and elevate it new experimental ways, while at the same time bringing it to a location near you! So put down whatever you are eating or drinking, and find these guys because it's one of the most exciting trucks our city has right now. <br><br>PS - Highly recommend the Speculoos, the bacon, and the lumpia.

My boyfriend and I ordered the lumpia, popcorn chicken and a side of rice. Coming from a very Filipino household, they definitely could've done better. The flavors in the lumpia were just lacking and the popcorn chicken was a bit too salty and a little burnt. Honestly, without the sauces, I probably wouldn't have been able to finish the food.

First was for some milk tea drinks (which were awesome). Second time we decided to try out their lumpia. Even though I was full from the food before, I couldn't help myself and finished these bad boys. The third time, I wanted to try their calamansi juice. Let me say, that was probably the best juice I've had in a long time! My girlfriend loved the drink too that she almost drank the whole cup and that was her first time having that kind of juice. <br><br>Customer service was phenomenal and very friendly. Since I just moved to the area, they told me where to look online to find where the food trucks would be next. I'm not sure what the guy's name is that was at the register that day but he was a very cool, down to earth guy. Keep it up guys! I give this place 5 stars!

Although it was good comfort food, it sure was not worth $9 for 6 small lumpias &amp; 2 scoops of rice. When it comes to food, I'm all about taste, quality, and price worthiness.

Wandering Boba,"West Sacramento, CA",9/20/2014,3,"I tried the milk tea with boba and thai tea. I expected better with all the raving reviews. The milk tea was a little sweet for me, so I had to wait for the ice to melt. Plus the cup was filled with ice and then they filled it up with milk tea. I felt a little ripped off. The milk tea itself can have more essence of tea in it and the boba was just OKAY! It wasn't any special, maybe a little overcooked. I didn't care for the thai tea. I couldn't taste the tea at all and the only reason I knew it was thai tea was because its orange color. There was way too much milk and ice in the cup.

Futhermore, they took 40+ minutes for ONE drink. Ridiculous. I ordered their special for the day:thai tea with a cheese cake floater.

I think they weren't expecting as big of a crowd as they got, my 2 drinks took like 30 minutes to get (I had enough time to order food from a different truck, come back, and then go to get dessert from another truck). They also ran out of those plastic lids where you just poke a hole into, so I got a plastic cap which I would have been okay with if they had a hole in the center for the straw. Oh and when I got my drink, my boba was still a bit warm so I think they had to cook more boba. Why 4 stars with some many ""issues"" because my milk tea was pretty darn good.

Right when I walked out of my car the weather seems to be very hot and I felt like I was sweating while standing in line. However they quickly open the window that was a blast of air conditioning that came at me which I felt was amazing. I ordered a shrimp taco at a carne asada taco which I read about and was excited to try. I receive my two tacos after a five minute wait and when I took it to the table that was to the right I sat down and opened it and well I was impressed already. I didn't know the shrimp was going to be fried shrimp which made the experience so much better. The carnet Asada taco was freshly top with a ton of guacamole and it was amazing!!!  I started out with a bite of the shrimp taco top with some lime juice that I had squeeze that came in my box. The crispiness mix with a taste of savory and you see a shrimp was perfect. Next I tried be corny Asada taco which was keeping and avocado sauce which I am obsessed with.

I'm from LA, so yes these are the small street tacos. The Ensenada (battered fish) was really good. Has a nice spicy kick to it. Comes with regular ingredients a fish taco has like cabbage and the sauce. Next taco up for execution was the grilled fish (grilled then shredded) regular ingredients without the spicy kick. Also a very good taco. Next we're two carne asada tacos. The guacamole and the salsa really set off the flavor of the taco. Overall the meat is just like regular asada to me. Nothing too special about the asada tacos. Overall they all had very good quantity and 4 tacos was enough to fill me up. I weigh 150 lbs with a fast metabolism. <br><br>It's not a DINE IN type of place. There is some tables around the side and rear of the restaurant, not enclosed but over a roof.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",6/23/2017,5,"Best tacos in the world? No. I can't say that but it's definitely the best in Sacramento! <br><br>Don't expect a super clean restaurant where a waiter is coming in and out. Chandos Tacos basically serves street tacos and the like. Many pictures on yelp to show the food ordering and pick up line they have as their system. There is seating in the back and side though so no worries! <br><br>Food? DELICIOUS. The adobado is my favorite choice of meat! Cool thing is that if you can't decide what you want and there's no line you can even ask for samples. The line gets pretty long sometimes so I wouldn't be standing there asking for samples when that happens just out of courtesy. <br>If there are any vegetarians out there, their vegetarian tacos are super good too. Grilled assorted veggies that even the lady who took my order recommended! She even said it's one of her favorites! (I'll be honest in saying that I've never had the veggie taco myself. My friend did and she loved it. I'm just not a veggie person myself. Did smell good though) <br>If you're not into tacos that's cool too. They have burritos (keep in mind the place isn't called Chandos burrito...just saying) nachos, and quesadillas too. I personally love the adobada quesadilla with lots and lots of lime. Mmmm yum. <br><br>Price is great for the food you get! <br>Ambiance is good for what it is. Fits the taco stand vibe. Oh in the back seating area they even have a sink for you to wash your hands.

More...what's the word...flavor?  Yes...flavor. It was bland. Bland to the point of being blah.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"El Dorado Hills, CA",6/28/2016,5,"You'll need a good strategy to obtain this delicious treasure, but it's well worth it, let me explain. We went to the ""Food-truck-in-the-foothills"" event last month in Placerville as part of a  fund raiser for the Union Mine Music Department. The event was a huge success with about 6 food trucks and hundreds of people. The CML line was the longest, so as I staked my claim in line, my wife picked up some ""appetizers"" from some of the other vendors. Team-work is essential in these situations !  We resolved that our wait in line was going to be about an hour, it turned out to be just 45 minutes. Long wait for a lobster roll, you might say, but we were on a ""quest"". We had seen the TV show, read the reviews, and had high expectations about trying CML. We had been following their travels, via social media, and was not going to let this opportunity slip by. Initially we were going to just split a lobster roll, after all we were stuffed with chicken wings and egg rolls while we waited, but once we've seen the ""delectable treasure"" from our fellow patrons, sharing was out-of-the-question, as each of us wanted to savor this New England treat. CML did not disappoint, the lobster was fresh and tasty on a perfectly toasted and buttery roll. Now I've seen some comments that they might be a bit ""pricey"", but these have to be from people that have never had a ""real"" New England lobster roll. In fact, CML, is a better value than some of the other lobster rolls I've tasted on the West coast. We're looking forward to running into them again so we can try some of their other offerings ( the lobster tacos looked amazing ).

Chando’s Tacos,"Seattle, WA",5/1/2018,4,I've only eaten here twice and I do have to say that the tacos are very good. Went gotten them each time we've gone and they definitely satisfy y'all craving until next time. I've always seen the truck on hwy 80 and said I'd try there and it's been well worth the wait. I ordered the carnitas tacos and it came with the lime wedges which were perfect. I do wish they would give bigger cups for the salsa bar though. I've tried each one and each time I just didn't have enough between the both of us. Overall the foods great and the atmosphere is great and I think it's really sweet to see a family pic hanging on the wall. <br>Definitely can't wait to go back but will bring a heavier sweater because the dining area was freezing.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=PG5h8KnYRNjACWzPUkC9RQ

I realize that I had to add my own beans for extra on my nachos it didn't include it so that was annoying. My friends order mulitas and they look so messy and burnt ( she lives there and even made comment saying what's going on with them today?).  Not sure  if we came in wrong time around 8 pm on Saturday night or they just can't really handle it when gets super busy.

Chando’s Tacos,"Natomas, Sacramento, CA",5/23/2017,5,"Tried Chando's Tacos today for the first time and it was a straight home run. Firstly this review is for their Food Truck.

The Tacos were Mexcellent,  flavorful and fresh. <br>We also ordered a Cheese quesadilla for the kiddos and it is a shareable portion. Can't comment on the taste as I don't eat my kiddos food but since they inhaled it so I am assuming it must be good.<br>Also ordered a Chicken Torta which tastes good but not great. I still love Mezcal Grills Chicken Torta.<br>Overall our first experience was great. For your convenience they also accept all major credit cards and/or cash. Their service was super speedy.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",9/8/2018,3,"Chando's is mostly great. The Chando's Combo (3 tacos &amp; drink) has been close to a dietary staple for me over the years, and their customer service is usually excellent despite the fact that they seem to draw more than their share of challenging customers. I have talked up their food for years, and I've even bought a Chando's t-shirt. <br><br>The reason that I am not giving five stars is that ordering online never works the way that it should. If you don't want to dig deep in to the online ordering process at Chando's, now is your last chance to bail on this review. Still here? Buckle up. Chando's is popular and is not a large building, so it tends to take a while to order and to get food at popular times. This is totally understandable, but it's also a reason why I was so excited when I found out that there was a way to order online. Sure, it would mean that I would no longer be able to hear as many of the sounds of the Harley-Davidson dealership across the street, and that my asthmatic lungs would no longer be able to breathe as many exhaust fumes from freeway and mall traffic on Arden, but I would be able to get food quickly! I learned that this was not to be. After ordering online, you must first approach the pick-up window, where a red sign says ""Online Orders."" However, there often isn't anyone to greet those customers, and you have to hope that you can make eye contact with someone to see if your food is ready in the seconds while  the window is open. If you arrived at the time listed in the e-mail that you receive, it's probably not. Orders have been around 15-20 minutes late literally every one of the 10 or so times that I've ordered online. Since I try to learn from my mistakes, I arrive about 15 minutes after the estimated time and hope to pick up my food without waiting too long. After picking up the food, you will probably have to go to a second window to get your drink, which means that you often have to look like you are cutting into the second line. Sometimes the people in line are not irritated by this. In the past I've been told that I don't have to go to the second window, but I've found that this is almost never true because the drink is rarely with the food. Keep in mind that this seems to be the best-case scenario when ordering online. <br><br>Today, I ordered online through their website and received a message that my food would be ready at ""about"" 12:44. Using the strategy mentioned above, I arrived at right about 1:00, hoping to grab my food and go. After waiting a few minutes behind a customer at the pickup window, I caught the attention of an employee and mentioned my order. He checked to see if it was ready, and I learned from another employee that with online orders, I'm supposed to notify them to make the food when I arrive. For an...online order. I'm so confused. <br><br>I asked again to make sure that I was understanding correctly, and she repeated it. Customers, who have presumably ordered online to save time, are apparently supposed to notify them when they arrive so that they can begin to make the food. There is no information about this available to customers when ordering online, which is a recipe for confusion and frustration. I received an apology-along with my drink, from the second window-just under 30 minutes after the estimated time that the order was supposed to be ready, and savored their delicious Chando's Combo. Remember, from way back, how I love this place? The food is fantastic, with lots of variety to choose from if you're not someone like me who almost always gets the same thing. Again, customer service is usually exceptional, and most of the people there have been very friendly over the years. The online ordering system, on the other hand, should be completely reorganized because it wastes their customers' time. Speaking of time, I'm realizing that it's kind of sad how long I've spent typing about a the efficiency of a restaurant's online ordering process. Before I go, a recap: keep supporting the great people and food at Chando's, but beware of ordering from them  online! Also, thank you for reading all the way to the end of my overly long review!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=56I8RjK8dRaNoksV5Os6Jw

Chando’s Tacos,"Land Park, Sacramento, CA",10/25/2016,3,"It took me a long time to finally try Chando's Tacos. I was not avoiding them, but with a decent taqueria withing walking distance of my house, I had to justify a trip to their location on Arden Way near Royal Oaks. This review is for the restaurant, not for the many food trucks that show up all over Sacramento.<br><br>This location is best described as a stationary food truck. There is no indoor restaurant. You order and receive food at the window standing on the sidewalk, then you can eat behind the store in a covered patio. Parking is decent, but it can be a challenge to enter and exit off Arden. There is a light rail station across the street for easy access to downtown offices.<br><br>On my visit, I had to finally try a lengua street taco and one of their famous mulitas with carne asada. Interestingly, they were still using pink colored corn tortillas to support breast cancer awareness. I will let you make your own pink taco jokes. They had pink chips and pico too, so I ordered them all and stood in the sun and smoke from the outdoor grill waiting for my food.<br><br>After a long, but reasonable wait, I got my food and headed out back to eat. The tongue was well cooked and seasoned and served with traditional toppings, but is too fatty for me. I guess I prefer my tongue in a different way. The mulita was very good with excellent flavor, but several pieces of the asada had too much gristle and was impossible to chew. The chips and pico were decent, but too similar to bagged chips and salsa to justify. I am not a guacamole fan, so all of my dishes went commando. Maybe their guac is the key.<br><br>Chando's Tacos is a nice addition to the Sacramento food scene, bringing taqueria style food to the masses at various food events and catering. Compared to other places, it did not really stand out for me above other neighborhood places. I really like the mulitas and will probably return for them, but with a different meat.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cBbVbcqUWrgYLP-06v0UXA

Chando’s Tacos,"Placerville, CA",8/9/2018,5,"We ordered the carnitas burrito and the adobada tacos. Both were very, very good. The meat was lean and well seasoned, and the guacamole was fresh and had a hint of lime cilantro or some sort of light citrus flavor that was a nice complement to the taste. A side note would be to get extra napkins, because some of the burritos leaked out of the wrapping. The people were very friendly, and the line moved smoothly. Regarding parking, there is a back overflow parking lot that is open through a fence, which made it easy to exit instead of using the busy street.

We say that as two  who were raised in Hispanic communities in SoCal. In my burrito there was delicious jack cheese, carnitas, lettuce, pico, cilantro (and not too much) a hint of guacamole and sour cream. It was the perfect marriage of flavors. Nothing overpowered the delicious carnitas which was truly the star. I am always looking for an authentic meat burrito, and for some reason they are hard to come by in Sacramento. This did not disappoint. I can hardly wait until the Citrus Heights location opens. Hubs liked his tacos a lot. He is not a fan of guac, so do be aware that tacos do come with guacamole on top.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Antelope, CA",6/22/2016,3,"Cousin's Maine Lobster came by for the lunch hour at my work (Wells Fargo Bank).  I was very excited to see that they were coming and when the menu was posted at work I was enticed.  Unfortunately, I was unable to try their star lobster roll as my dietary restrictions limit bread consumption but was happy to see that they had the soup options and tacos.  With the warming 100+ weather I was hesitant to try the soups so hopefully I will catch that in the fall or winter.  <br>Menu selection is decent with not too little or too many items to choose from. They definitely make the choice difficult but not overwhelming. It all sounds really tasty...I am curious about the ice cream. <br>I ordered the lobster tacos instead of shrimp as the lobster is considered their ""lead roll"" for the ""food truck performance"". The pico de gallo is fresh and tasty with a little heat/ kick but outnumbers the lobster in quantity on the taco.  The lobster was bland as I tried a piece before I took a bite of the taco in its ultimate form. I was hoping that the lobster would have a more flavor and depth of seasoning since that is the focus of the entrée and should be able to stand alone.  The cream sauce was complimentary to the flavors and not overpowering. To my dismay though the tortillas were cold and rubbery to chew.  The tortilla has nice color on it, but having to bite/rip the taco did not make for pleasant lunch consumption.      <br>I honestly cannot give them less than 3 stars because I have not tried the infamous Connecticut Lobster Roll but what I did try was a disappointment.  The staff was friendly and service was great.  It could have just been an off day for the tacos.  If given the chance to try again, I will.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=3fjl8gJ9EvnyAYHXr2cZfQ

Tortillas and cheese, those are cheap fillers and totally could be built up in size to mask the lack of lobster tricking me into believing it to be worth $15+ right? Not so much. We get food trucks at my work daily, and this one hands down was the worst value. :-( quesadilla chips and a drink $21+  filled me up about as much as a $2 combo at mc Donald's :-/   Every other truck at the $15 mark is an over flowing tray of food.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",7/14/2015,4,"We visited this truck at the Yolo Brewing Co on the 4th of July. It was HELLA hot outside and we were sweating in the REALLY long line (at 11:30am!), but there was no turning back after I started craving a lobster roll. They had two types of rolls - the Maine or the Connecticut style. The Maine roll was served cold with mayo and the Connecticut was warm with butter. I saw the word BUTTER and my decision was made. We each ordered a roll and also got lobster tacos (comes with 3) and the lobster tots to share. I was worried it wouldn't be enough food because I saw other people in front of me get their rolls and they looked tiny! When I got my order, the roll still looked small to me and I regretted not ordering one of each roll. Then I bit into it and OMG, so MUCH lobster!!! JK, you can never have TOO much lobster. But for real, they really packed the lobster in the tiny roll! Who needs that many carbs anyway?! The tacos and the tots were basically the same - delicious, creamy sauce with pico de gallo on top and also PACKED with lobster bits! The food is pricey, especially for a food truck, but they definitely don't skimp on the lobster! Treat yo self!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=C4GInuGl6ERuOph3jLg97g

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Sacramento, CA",8/16/2015,3,"Granted there is a lot of hype surrounding this little truck, but I was a bit disappointed. I was prepared for the prices ($14 for rolls, $7-10 for chowder), but what we got in return was so... underwhelming. I thought we would split the Connecticut lobster roll, but there wasn't much to split. The chowders was nothing compared to the goodness I get at shore towns like Bodega Bay, and I was surprised when the boyfriend told me he got the $10 size when I would have guessed he got the $7 version. I guess I also got confused and thought that $2 Cape Cod chips meant fries, when in fact it meant charging double for the Cape Cod brand of chips (it says $1 on the bag). I finished the meal thinking we could have gotten a sushi boat for the price we paid at this food truck establishment, but good on them for such a successful enterprise. There was a line before they even opened, and by the time we left (we enjoyed our food supplemented with beer at New Helvetia), the line was down the block.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=t3T_2Pn62Ru9OFtXud_PYw

As far as food trucks go, prices are reasonable, their schedule is almost exclusively breweries, so what better than fresh Maine lobster and craft beer. The lobster rolls are spot on, exactly what you would get in New England, fresh lobster on a buttered roll. I recently discovered the tots which were also ridiculously delicious.

Melted to perfection, with cheese that oozes from the sides and becomes golden crunchy.  One bite and your toes curl up from the infused combination of Latino flavors!  I top mine with their habanero salsa, perfect combination.  <br><br>Potato tacos-(taco de papa) Ridiculously delicious- corn tortilla filled with mashed potato and perhaps cheese (this is how I remember it), deep fried to a golden crunch that only one can describe as pure goodness.  These are beyond addicting!  These bring back memories from my visits to Juchipila Zachatecas- eating those wonderful ""tacos de papa"" from the street vendors - the best!!!<br><br>Now I won't get into the rest of the menu because I will be here all day, but you get the point- if you haven't tried the two mentioned I highly recommend them on your next trip, you won't regret it.<br>Mexican food is typically the kind of food where you can get more bang for your buck......<br>prices are typical, and portions are within reason- This is not a hyped review- but coming from a  person who cater's Mexican food for private parties- these folks are legit. <br><br>Muchas Gracias to the owners of Chando's...

Growing up in San Antonio TX Mexican food restaurants are like McDonald's. You can find one just about on every block. The real authentic stuff! So I am definitely a true lover of Mexican food and know the difference between authentic and the fakes. <br><br>I wanted to try a little bit of everything but of course my eyes were bigger than my stomach lol.. From what I ordered I tried the mulita, a chicken taco, asada taco, and a churro. I LOVED the tacos. They were well seasoned and the toppings they put on it really sets off the taco. Now the mulita.. Umm.. Well it has a lot of cheese which I didn't like. Next time I'll probably just stick to the tacos. The churro was tasty but my drink the Jamaica (hibiscus tea) was amazing.

Cousins Maine Lobster - Sacramento,"Redding, CA",1/23/2016,2,"I absolutely love seafood and lobster is among my favorite seafood dishes. When I discovered Cousin's Maine Lobster had a truck in Sacramento I had to make a trip out to try some of their rolls. Especially after all the hype from the cousins being on Shark Tank. <br><br>I ended up ordering a Maine lobster roll, a Connecticut lobster roll, and a bowl of lobster bisque. While the staff was nice and the service was relatively quick, I didn't really feel like either roll lived up to the hype. It wasn't bad, it just didn't blow me away like I was expecting. In fact, it was rather bland and tasteless. The only thing I could really discern as far as flavor goes was the buttery bread roll (very yeasty) so I was pretty disappointed about that. To be quite honest, I've tasted far more flavorful lobster at Red Lobster. What I got at Cousins was interesting and I'm glad I tried it, but overall, it wasn't something I'll be stumbling over myself trying to get back to any time soon. As for the the lobster bisque, it wasn't very good at all, and I hardly got any lobster meat in mine. I would literally describe the amount of meat as ""a small pinch,"" which is unfortunate, because again, the lobster bisque at Red Lobster completely blows the bisque you get from Cousins out of the water, by a long shot, both in taste, richness, and the amount of lobster meat you actually get in the soup.<br><br>Just to clarify, I am in no way affiliated with Red Lobster, nor am I trying to send business their way. In fact, my local Red Lobster has actually gone downhill quite a bit over the last few years in terms of quality and service, but even then, to say Red Lobster has more flavorful lobster meat and WAY better bisque than Cousins is kinda shocking and definitely took me by surprise. (The only reason I use Red Lobster as a reference is because where I live, they're basically the closest seafood establishment to me, so it's inevitable that they're going to be directly compared to Cousins) <br><br>Would I recommend visiting Cousins Maine Lobster in Sacramento? ...I guess. I think it's worth trying at least once and deciding for yourself what you think, but for me, it's not something I'm going to be rushing out again for right away. <br><br>Overall rating: Meh.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=fqdV0K3SaJuKDsqILaW9Bg

There was plenty of lobster on the sandwich. My only complaint and why I would not order it again is because the lobster is served cold on a warm bun. It would of been so much better if the lobster was served warm.  (Update) I received a response back and see that they have a lobster roll sandwich where the lobster is served warm as well.

I had been craving lobster for a long time and didn't mind standing in the long line. When we finally got to the front my husband ordered the lobster roll and I ordered just the tail that came with melted butter. We picked up our order and walked to a winery down the block to enjoy our purchase or so we thought. The over priced lobster roll, $14, was slathered with too much mayo hiding the few pieces of lobster on the very small hot dog bun but even worse was the over cooked dried up lobster tail with no butter for $13!!!

Chando’s Tacos,"Vacaville, CA",10/20/2018,2,"I was not satisfied with this trip to chandos at all. I got the papa fries and they were literally soaking in a pile of grease at the bottom of the container. The steak was chewy and cut in huge pieces, on top of the mediocre food the customer service was very unprofessional. He opened the pickup order window and said ""wassup"" then when I asked for the drinks with my order he told me to just cut in front of everyone in the other line and get them. Mind you there's like 20 people in line. He kinda just slammed the window in my face without a word after I grabbed the bag, no ""have a nice day"" or ""thank you"" idk to me that just looks really bad on a company especially when the food is already lacking as it is. When I first came to chandos back in 2014/15 (not sure the exact year) it was some of the best Mexican I'd ever had and I always remembered chandos for that, so it was really disappointing to have an experience like this after looking forward to it for so long. They used to grill the meat right in front of you on this big bbq right next to where you order, I read reviews about people saying it sucks now that they've expanded the business, not sure if it's because of that or new management or whatever the reason, but this place is the complete opposite of what I remember. If you are a person who reads reviews before you go anywhere (like me) pay attention to the bad ones and trust your instinct, I honestly feel like I wasted my time and money coming here, very disappointing.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9QpyyFp6FM5c_IB7Xo08yw

With such an exceptional overall rating, I knew I had to check it out.<br><br>The place is just a window on the side of the road. The menu off to the side on a chalkboard - your order from one window and pick up from the other. You can go sit in the back, where they have various plastic picnic tables set up - until they call your name.<br><br>I went with 3 tacos - and a mini torta. So glad they had a mini option - cause I really wanted to try the torta - and it was amazing.<br><br>Torta: This is a Mexican sandwich. I got it with Carnitas - slow cooked pork. The seasoning was great - and a little different than the pork tacso I got (cochinitas &amp; adobada).<br><br>Tacos: all of them came STACKED, with two corn shells, you can try and split the shells to catch all the stuff that falls out and create another taco, I preferred that they were kinda stuck together so they gave my taco a little more structure. They each come with a squirt of guac.<br><br>Adobada - pork, slow roasted with adobo and pineapples. It has a kick to it so if you don't like spicy, skip this one. I loved it.<br>Carne Asada - char broiled steak. Juicy, tasty, and delicious.<br>Cochinitas - Also pork, but cooked different - very juicy, and flavorful.<br>*Also, they had pink taco shells. I think this is for breast cancer awareness month.<br><br>The service here was also fantastic. The young lady at the register took the time to walk me through what all the meats were - and offered up the adobada as her favorite - she mentioned it had a nice kick to it, so I was ready for it.<br><br>Bottom line is - these were some of the best tacos I've ever had.

I would give them more stars but there are just a couple of things I can't look past. I work in an office and we order food from Chando's almost every single day and every time we order, without fail, they forget something in our order, whether it be a burrito or a couple tacos, or even the chips, they always forget something. Another issue that I have is that if we make any adjustments to the menu items (ie: no dairy, no salsa etc.) half the time they come with that stuff on or in them anyways. I also got yelled at just today by the guy in the window for picking my order up later than when they estimated it would be ready, but, every time I show up ON TIME to pick up my food I have to wait for 10-15 minutes for them to finish the order. Not the best customer service in the world.

By the time I go to pay, the cashier says that my order had been ready. I ask for a fresh order of tacos and she says that my order had already been made. After wasting 20 minutes in line, I take to tacos and go. First, the Chando's tacos were already cold. And secondly, the tacos were not that great. You would expect that charging $2.00 for a taco would mean more flavorful food and of better quality... Chando's Tacos failed on both quality of food and customer service.

Chando’s Tacos,"Mueller, Austin, TX",6/25/2016,5,"I lived in Los Angeles for five years and change. <br><br>Subtracting the 2.3 years spent in traffic, that's still roughly 900 days of time largely devoted to consuming the best Mexican food around. A great experience eating and exploring a style of cuisine that has become a member of my Culinary Mount Rushmore (Lincoln's visage).<br><br>It also means I suffer from Taco Bias, a condition endemic to Southern California, New Mexico, Arizona and parts of Texas. It's the irrational, but often correct, belief that all tacos north of their county line are inferior to the tortilla-wrapped gold their area produces.<br><br>A diagnosis of Taco Bias, while rarely fatal, is thought to be incurable and often insufferable. If I had a dollar for every taco place my northerner and east coast buddies had to sit through my condemnation of, I'd be able to buy back some of the friends I lost through this insidious disease.  <br><br>Fortunately, I've been able to achieve some remission in the Sacramento area thanks to this beloved institution. I don't know Chando, but I know good Mexican food. And so does Chando.<br><br>You can tell when you roll up. Gas station across the way. Grungy, yet charming eating area in the back. Order window in the front. Cashier listens and the line cooks actually get the instructions right. Extra salsa, sides of guac provided with minimal fuss. And the meat cooks right in front of your face on the grills, pushing your hunger to it's limits as the line snakes its way towards your next order opportunity.<br><br>I haven't tried all their permutations of meat, spice and carb-container, but I've had quite a few. It's a cliche, but you can't go wrong. Just more and more right.<br><br>I adore horchata, and the version here is merely decent. It makes it the lowlight of the menu. They've got about a dozen different fillings. They dazzle in burrito, mulita or quesadilla form, but my go-tos are the torta (specifically it's mini option) and the namesake tacos.<br><br>The adobada is basically their al pastor and the consensus king of their meats. It's spicy, never over-cooked yet always packed with that just-grilled heat that only the finest of backyard 'cue can match. It's the only absolute requirement your first time around.<br><br>Some people swear by carne asada. I usually find it too tough, chewy or charred. Chando's grills it pretty hardcore here, and you will definitely find some black bits. But the method to their madness is a condensed, beefy flavor, perfectly supplemented by the balanced, slightly sour heat of their green sauce. <br><br>Their chorizo: fatty as hell and filled with enough spice to make McCormick blush. The way it oughta be. One of the only meats that shines best outside of the taco form. Quesadillas kill with it in particular. And burritos. Anything with enough wrapping to contain the grease. <br><br>The lengua: tasty, odd, tangy in green sauce and one of my favorite orders. The grilled fish tacos are a dark horse favorite of many; clean, well-cooked tilapia with a creamy special sauce and crunchy cabbage. The sauce is alright. A little low on heat. But you can fix that. <br><br>And the cochinita. Stewed pork in its own habanero sauce. A thousand times yes. It'll burst out of a taco, making a wonderful mess. Those who prefer it neater, get it in a burrito. Those who want a bit of both: the torta starts out ready for the challenge, then eventually collapses and becomes the pile of delicious flavor-soaked soft-griddled sandwich you didn't know you truly wanted. <br><br>Order more than you think you need. The line will invariably be longer then when you initially ordered, and it'll be hard to stop putting these in you once you start.<br><br>If Chando's can cure my Taco Bias, even if only for a blissful hour, it can sure as heck cure any craving or hunger you find yourself beset with.

The ensanada taco had a generous amount of beer battered fish , tangy crema, and cabbage. It was amazing ! Although the torta was just ok to me, I did really like the roll. The horchata is a must try! Not too sweet, not too thick, it was perfect ! <br><br>I'm hoping to try the nachos next time because they looked really good. Thanks chandos, you've won my heart with your tacos :)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=f7QJaUVz-BvdAddFhJ2Fkw

Chando’s Tacos,"Orland, CA",1/15/2018,2,"This place has outside eating only which isn't horrible but it wasn't what I was looking for when trying to choose a place to eat. I love Mexican food so I decided let's do it anyways. I'm not scared to eat a taco trucks or restaurants like this. I've done it all over the state. Chando's essentially is a taco truck. Everyone was friendly which is awesome for this day in age. I chose to get the Mulitas since it was at the top of the menu and had good reviews. I also saw the tacos got good reviews. I also grabbed the Chando's pappitas which are fries covered with your choice of meat, sour cream, onions and cilantro and nacho cheese. They were advertised on the front window where I ordered my feast. I was in the mood for Mexican food and I couldn't decide what I wanted. My brother in law ordered chips and salsa and a carnitas burrito. My tacos were carnitas and the mulita was also carnitas. Tacos are your typical taco truck style. Unfortunately they were cold. Not cool from sitting but cold like out of the fridge. The Mulitas were hot and very good. I'd order it again if I wanted to return but I probably won't. THe fries were at least hot but the guacamole tasted like store bought. Should have been more onions and cilantro and way less nacho cheese. A major disappointment since they did not even look like the picture on the window. Brother in law got the carnitas burrito and it was cold too. Chips and salsa were well, The chips were stale. Salsa was good. Nothing special but solid. Food came on a dirty tray which isn't horrible. I'm not that much of a snob. I wasn't planning on eating off of it but dang. So with the inconsistent, cold and kinda pricey food for what you'll get I rate this place at 2 stars. The food didn't taste bad. We ate it all just very disappointed.

I'm pretty stingy with my 5-star reviews, so I wanted to make sure Chando's was up to snuff.<br><br>Suffice to say, I think it is.<br><br>Is it terrible of me to say that I am still shocked that a taco stand so far north is this amazeballs? Definitely comparable to some of the delicious taco places that I frequented during my SoCal days.<br><br>Tacos at Chando's are $1.85, sans tax. They also do not partake in Taco Tuesday deals. A while ago, one of my friends asked them why, and the answer was that ""they don't really need to."" On the one hand, this is somewhat of a pompous answer, but on the other hand, it's honestly kind of true. There has ALWAYS been a line at Chando's whenever I have gone, and this is just a testament to the quality and deliciousness of Chando's. Clearly they don't need a gimmick to attract customers, because their tacos do all the talking.<br><br>The fish tacos are amazing. I have no idea what kind of sauce they use, but it has the right amount of kick to it, and the flavoring is perfect. I am not adventurous enough with my palate to experiment with some of the more ambitious meat options that Chando's offers, including lengua and cabeza, but my friends who have have only had good things to say. Also, I almost feel like it's a mark of authenticity for a taco place to offer lengua and cabeza. The carnitas, asada, chicken, and adobada are all delicious-- super flavorful and tender. They cook the meat right in front of the taco stand, so as you're waiting in line, the smell wafts over you, just begging you to order all the things. Also, this has the unfortunate side effect of causing all your clothes and hair to smell like amazing Chando's meat, even long after you've left, but hey, there are worse things to smell like.<br><br>For $1.90 you can also get yourself some horchata or jamaica, which is a nice complement to your food as well.<br><br>I also really really appreciate that Chando's takes cards, because I know a lot of smaller taco stands do not, so that earns Chando's another plus in my book.<br><br>Admittedly, the line can get fairly long, but Chando's is also open late-ish (until 10pm), so it's a good option as well for munchies later in the evening.<br><br>Two things I would change about Chando's:<br>1.) The parking lot is... not the greatest. There are not that many spots in their paved lots, and their overflow lot is essentially a gravel lot, which always sounds terrible as you're driving through it. <br>2.) The area that this Chando's is in is kind of sketch. Past the glitz and glamour of the mall area, this part of Arden seems less brightly lit and shadier.<br><br>tl;dr: Hands down my favorite taco place in Sactown. This may seem like blasphemy to a lot of my friends, but I would say Chando's is just as good, if not better than the ""super authentic"" places down south.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",8/19/2014,5,"I'm pretty lucky, because I can literally walk to Chando's in five minutes from where I work...pretty cool. However, I now have a routine, on Tuesday, aka Taco Tuesday in our household. I've created a Pavlovian situation when I get home, in that Hubby EXPECTS those three chicken tacos and I can figuratively see him drooling at the sight of them...every single Tuesday now! Actually, it makes it easy for me to figure out what's for dinner on Tuesdays! Yay! Honestly, I've made Taco Tuesday so routine that the lovely ladies working there know me by name...so awesome :)<br><br>Tonight, I got Hubby his usual three chicken tacos. For me, since I'm watching my carb intake, I asked if I could just buy some carnitas meat. I was then informed that, though it's not on their blackboard, Chando's does offer burrito bowls! Say WHAT? Really? Woot!! I got my burrito bowl home, and tore into that sucker, and it was DELICIOUS! Best dang burrito bowl I've ever had...no lie, no joke, no kidding. Grilled, seasoned chicken; shredded lettuce, onions, sour cream, guac, and a yummy mild (because I'm a wuss) green salsa. <br><br>With 20% tip added in, my total was just over $7 for my chicken burrito bowl...that's awesome, because now I can totally justify walking those five minutes from work to have a Chando's burrito bowl for lunch. Huzzah!<br><br>I cannot wait to try another burrito bowl for dinner next week, this time with carnitas. And, gathering by the reaction to his taste of my food, Hubby will want me to get him a chicken burrito bowl next week instead of his usual chicken tacos!

I've been to this location a few times as well as the Roseville one and the food is good but not worth the hype of it. The lady who always takes the orders at Arden is the rudest cashier ever and will literally roll her eyes at you and give dirty looks while ordering. The tacos are tasty but the tortillas fall apart and the chicken has way too much sauce on it. The quesadillas are good but so greasy you can't eat the whole thing without getting sick.

Chando’s Tacos,"Ann Arbor, MI",9/11/2015,3,"I'm really picky with my mexican food, my standards are a bit high, but given my ethnic background... I think it's only fair. Two thumbs up for Chando's!<br><br>Food: My favorite item to order is the chicken quesadilla. In my opinion, this is the closest thing to an authentic mexican quesadilla. Everything inside the quesadilla, not the usual quesadilla with a side of guac and other stuff... it's all on the inside. The chicken is seasoned to perfection, extremely juicy and seasoned just right. Warm, cheesy and delicious on the inside; crispy on the outside. One of the things I like best about this quesadilla is the fact that it's not insanely oily, usually if it's soggy, you know they used a lot of oil... however, the one stays crispy throughout. I dream of this quesadilla too much. The mulitas are also amazing, basically a grilled sandwiched taco filled with cheese. Carne asada tastes better in the mulitas! Not the biggest fan of the burritos, the portion is definitely huge, but nothing really sets them apart from the next burrito. I don't care for their free chips, salsas are hit or miss. <br><br>Ambiance: Outdoor seating in the back of the shop. It's covered, but still gets really hot and usually a lot of flies from my experience. It's difficult finding parking here, I'd much rather pick up and take it to go, you may enjoy your food a lot more if you do this. The times I've tried to eat there, it's really uncomfortable and just the hassle of finding parking makes me ""hangry."" <br><br>Price: Reasonably priced considering the large portions... especially if you order a burrito or quesadilla.<br><br>Overall: I like Chando's a lot, definitely authentic in flavor, portions and price! However, it's a mission to get your food, so I recommend ordering ahead or ordering to-go.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ZlzS3eyFdl5JaSK0JGbSdw

Chando’s Tacos,"Daly City, CA",12/10/2017,1,"I went last night and ordered a Steak Burrito, the line wasn't that long which was good and the cashier lady was pleasant, the woman you pick up your order from, not so much. I'll acknowledge the fact that they are a restaurant open after 9pm, that is greatly appreciated. It was freezing outside and I ordered like everyone else and waited patiently by their pickup window. As soon as I realized that the people whom ordered after me and had a significantly larger order than mine were given their order I calmly walked up to the pickup window and waited about 3-4 mins for the pickup woman to acknowledge my presence, I kindly asked if perhaps my order was ready and that perhaps I had made the mistake of not picking it up when it was. She was dumbfounded about the situation and asked her fellow sidekicks if they knew anything about the mysterious Burrito. A few minutes go by and she asks how long ago had I made the order and I told her that I had made it before the people that had just left with their order. They had obviously made a mistake and I was told they were going to make the burrito for me at that instant, if it matters I'm hispanic and this interchange was held in Spanish. I finally get my Burrito without any acknowledgment of their mistake or console for my extra waiting (this is the most important part where a small business would hypothetically create a positive spin on the situation and go above and beyond where the customer leaves knowing they at least tried to make amends ie, ""sorry for the extra wait, here's some free Guac or chips, etc."" since the problem was entirely created by the business and not the consumer). Had I not proactively approached the woman I would probably still be there to this day waiting for that infamous Steak Burrito.<br><br>The meat was chewy (not good) and I spit out a few pieces of inedible fat, but the rest of the burrito was fine.

Chando’s Tacos,"San Gabriel, CA",8/31/2015,1,"Chando's Tacos: a careless and stingy business who's shameless about lying and apathetic about their customers' health. <br><br>My parents and I stopped on our way to Red Bluff from Los Angeles (day one of our road trip to Canada). It had been a tiring six hour drive, and when we got here, we were absolutely starving. I had to wait in line for almost forty-five minutes (of which half the time was spent baked in the sun because there weren't enough umbrellas to cover us all). <br><br>The first thing that bothered me was how the lady working the register kept sliding the mini glass door open and shut whenever she talked to the customers. When she had to consult with her boss, she closed the door. When she had to talk to the customer, it opened. Why? Just get on with the orders, and stop closing the damn door - I would've had to wait at least fifteen minutes less if it weren't for this. <br><br>The biggest problem I have with this business is that they LIED to my mom and me about whether there were tomatoes in any of the tacos we ordered. ""No tomatoes"", they said, when we were first ordering. We asked them repeatedly, making sure and also mentioning the fact that my dad's HIGHLY allergic to them (as this was a routine for us already). Plus, he also was the driver of this whole trip, so if anything happened to him, we would be off to the hospital instead of Canada.  <br><br>We got our tacos, and the first thing my dad does is skeptically pick at the contents. Luckily, he noticed that there was some sauce that seemed to contain tomatoes, so we went back to the window, bringing these plates, checking whether there were any. <br><br>And the conversation is as follows...<br><br>Me: Are there any tomatoes in these?<br>Chando's: No.<br>Me: Are you sure? It looks like there might be some in the sauce. <br>Chando's: No we don't have tomatoes. <br>Me: Is this some type of salsa on the chicken?<br>Chando's: Yes, that's salsa.<br>Mom: So you have tomatoes in these tacos?<br>Chando's: No, there's no tomato.<br>*the boss (i think it's the boss...) walks over*<br>Boss: Is everything okay?<br>Mom: We're checking whether there are tomatoes in these tacos.<br>Boss: There is no tomato, ma'am. <br>Mom: So why is there salsa?<br>Boss: Our salsa contains pineapple, cilantro, etc. etc..., and TOMATO. <br><br>I honestly do not know what they thought ""allergic to tomatoes"" meant. Needless to say, my dad was absolutely livid when he went to talk to the boss, because the boss kept denying how there were no tomatoes in the tacos. Okay, if there is salsa ON the tacos, that means that there is tomato in them. Understand? (It feels like I'm talking to first graders here...) If a person is ALLERGIC to tomatoes, then they're allergic to tomato sauce, tomato paste, tomato chunks, tomato being marinated with the meat, or the most obvious of them all - SALSA. <br><br>It took so long for them to actually take the tacos back and remake them without tacos. And all they put in it were onions and cilantro, with no meat. How DISGUSTING is that - they didn't even bother trying to make it remotely edible. They wasted our time, our money, and completely destroyed Day One of our road trip. I blame you, Chando. <br><br>They also overcharged us three tacos extra, even though we repeated our order at least five times to the lady who annoyingly kept opening and closing that glass door. The original bill should've came out around $17, but we ended up paying $26. I only realized this after we left the place (because we were so busy trying to figure out that whole tomato situation) - HUGE mistake on our part. <br><br>Anyway, I'm definitely not sorry for this one star review because, bad service? Not the best Mexican food (haha, no offense, but I've had better and more authentic Mexican food that's cheaper and CARES about whether their food could KILL their customers. Um, yes - some allergic reactions can lead to death. Fun fact guys). And blatantly lying to our faces about the mistake they made? I guess food allergies aren't as big as a concern compared to how much business and money they get! <br><br>TLDR<br>+ do not come here if you have food allergies because they do not care about their customers' health #nuffsaid<br>+ they want your money, not your satisfaction<br>+ if you wanna wait fifteen-thirty minutes in the sun for average Mexican food, i question your sanity... CHIPOTLE is even better lol. <br>+ parking sucks (don't even take the time to try parking here - it ain't worth it)<br><br>Bottom line?

Chando’s Tacos,"Elk Grove, CA",8/25/2015,3,"After stalking Chando's on social media for so long, I finally checked out their Arden location. <br><br>This location has an order window and covered open air seating in the back. There is limited parking in the front and additional parking on a gravel lot in the back. I got there around noon on a Friday and the line was already pretty long and stretched out onto the sidewalk. The day we went wasn't especially hot and there is limited shade for the people waiting in line. Had it been in the 100's, I'm sure standing in line would have been unpleasant.<br><br>We ordered our food, which came out pretty quickly. I got three tacos (potato, fried fish and chicken) along with a birria burrito. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to try a variety, especially the potato taco, which I've been craving since I left San Jose.<br><br>The burrito was a huge mess- literally! Birria is beef stew which does tend to get messy. However, this was even messier than usual since the burrito does not include any beans or rice. I didn't read their online menu close enough and assumed that it did. The meat was great, but really needed something more than a flour tortilla. <br><br>The tacos were more in line with what I was expecting. Each taco was a decent size for $1.85 each. The potato was my fave! There was a red sauce that is not listed on their menu that really made the dish pop. If you have never tried a potato taco, you should remedy that very soon. The fish and chicken were also very delicious. So much so that we went to their Power Inn location the next day because we couldn't stop thinking about it.<br><br>Compared to the Power Inn location, this one just pales in comparison. Like I mentioned, it's open air which I'm sure is not the best in the Sacramento heat. They have picnic tables in the back area where they store old equipment and other assorted items. It's not really a restaurant so much as a glorified food stand. <br><br>TLDR: Tacos are the bomb! Burritos don't have beans or rice.

Chando’s Tacos,"Santa Clara, CA",9/11/2014,3,"I'm not from the Sac area, but happened to be cutting through one weekend evening.  I wanted to grab some grub before heading back to the Bay Area - something cheap and quick.  Pulled up Yelp - and behold - Chando's Tacos with 900+ reviews and 4.5 stars.  Fired up the GPS and was there 20 minutes before closing (at 10pm).  <br><br>I'm not familiar with the city, but the place didn't seem to be in the greatest neighborhood.  I was relieved that there were still a handful of people there, but one by one they started to leave from the time we ordered to the time we left.  I'm not the most paranoid person, but did feel a bit uneasy as we didn't know what area we were in and not too many people were around, aside from a few sketchy people roaming the streets.  However, I also realize most good Mexican food is in dumpy areas...<br><br>Walk-up order window with a chalkboard menu to the side.  We ordered the carne asada tacos plus the carnitas tacos ($1.85 each).  Took about 5 to 10 minutes to get our food.  There are a few tables to the side of the stand; I did like that they also had some bench seating behind the stand.  <br><br>The tacos were about average size and came with a good glop of guac.  I grabbed some sauces as well to add some flavor/heat.  I picked up the taco, took a bite anddd...drummmm roll.....meh.  Average taco.  I was a little disappointed - the one place I chose to eat in Sac and the food was mediocre.  What-the-hay.  I can't even say which one I preferred more - carnitas or carne asada as both were meh.  <br><br>Perhaps the fact that they were almost closing could have been a factor.  Last dibs on ingredients probably isn't ideal.  I don't know.  I risked my life in a sketchy neighborhood for a meh taco.  Sigh.  <br><br>Anyway - if you're looking for an OK taco, this is the place.  Unless you're coming with a big group, I'd stick with a daytime visit.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Fh6AdCIhCmb3CwNWUY2uKA

Instead I got a shredded mystery meat ( I think it was pork), and a veggie burrito with no beans and packed with onions. Young kid wearing hair net. I should of been suspicious when he initially ordered a meat burrito after I said veggie. While waiting another customer complained that it was wrong order. This dude was totally out of it. We were on our way down the highway before we found out. Also our food sucked. Tips on surviving this taco stand...Maybe just order the fish taco and go somewhere else if you want something different. Test your food before you take it away. Run away if that dude is taking your order because even if you correct him he will get it wrong.

I figured this place must be amazing and had been meaning to come here since I live really close. I finally made it out and waited in the line, which didn't seem so long once I got my food. While you're in line, you can smell them grilling the meats and it smells so delicious. You go up to order at one window and pick up your order in another. We ordered nachos de carne asada, asada burrito, and two tacos: adobada and grilled fish. OMG that first bite into the fish tacos was heaven...the fish was spicy (which I love) and it was flavorful...the adobada was equally tasteful. Which is something some Mexican restaurants in the area lack: the flavor that is just perfect--not too bland and not too overwhelming...<br><br>Now, my favorite was the carne asada...Chando's carne asada is unlike a lot of Mexican restaurants that I've been to since moving out to Cali.

Not cuz I'm on a diet,  I just don't like sweet drinks. I could have definitely ate more cuz you just can't have 3 street tacos...who does that? But I refrained cuz I didn't want to get sleepy on the drive home.  Give Chando's a visit.  You won't be disappointed!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WnSF_-kTazxPASvxMKMIzw

Chando’s Tacos,"Vallejo, CA",7/30/2016,3,"I went here seeking authentic and flavorful tacos but was disappointed. <br><br>The tacos were simply...ok. <br><br>I ordered abodaba tacos, cochinita tacos, and fish tacos. <br><br>Do not order abodaba  tacos or cochinita tacos.  <br><br>The abodaba lacked flavor. There was no hint of pineapple. <br><br>When I asked about the cochinita tacos, the lady at the register described it as REALLY spicy so I had to order it but when I took my first bite... It was quite the opposite. It was REALLY mild and bland. <br><br>Do order fish tacos and/or asada nachos.<br><br>The fish tacos were light, fresh, and very flavorful! I wish I ordered all fish tacos. <br><br>The asada nachos were good!  The asada was tasty. So definitely if you want to get a flavorful dish, make asada your choice of meat. <br><br>All in all, I wouldn't go out of my way to make a trip back here. However, If I'm in the area and it's after 10pm, I'd go here to pick up decent food since it's open till 3am. <br><br>Note: When I asked for jalapeños, I was served a cup of movie nachos jalapeños.

Chando’s Tacos,"Fremont, CA",7/28/2017,4,"Literally the best quesadilla of my life. I can't speak for its authenticity, but it tasted AMAZING. It seemed like it was made differently than your usual quesadilla. They are generous with the filling, which is important for me when it comes to Mexican food. <br><br>The tacos were amazing as well, obviously, as advertised in their restaurant name. Actually, it's more of like a little taco shop. There is no ""inside."" You basically order from one window, they call your name and you pick up from another window. I think I remember a few tables outside, but there is not really much dining area either. As for parking, there's no actual paved lot for you to park in, rather a gravel-filled empty space where people kinda decided they were going to park their cars. There's not much room so when you turn in, you have to go out through the back where you'll find more unpaved, gravel-filled space with a bunch of cars parked randomly. But I digress..  I wouldn't say these tacos were the BEST tacos I've ever had, but they are definitely up there on my list of best taco places, tied with a few other really good taco spots.<br><br>The burritos were only okay, we shared one and it lacked flavor. They packed it with a thick tortilla wrap that seemed to be grilled but the tortilla was so thick it took away from the flavor of its filling. The burrito itself lacked sauce probably because the filling and tortilla soaked it all up. Overall, it was not bad but I'd skip on the burrito next time I stop by Chando's. I will definitely be getting another quesadilla though!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=d7Ntwi9lckdKSowJQ1MT5w

Chando’s Tacos,"Edmonton, Canada",2/17/2017,4,"If you are looking for some super tasty Mexican food without much for atmosphere.  This is your place.  <br><br>This place looks like someone setup a food truck on the sidewalk and have since added to it.  Kinda like those trailer parks where they try to make it a bit more homey feeling by adding AstroTurf, and putting patio furniture out.  <br><br>All kidding aside, Chandos serves up some excellent Mexican food.  You start by standing on the sidewalk on a busy street (Arden Way).  So as you try to view the chalkboard menu, while wondering if the homeless people in the area are going to be run over by the speeding cars going past, you get plenty of time to read the  rather extensive menu.  <br><br>You order from one window and you pick up from another.  The longest part of the wait is waiting to get to the order window.  I'm really not sure why it takes so long.  As soon as you order, your food comes out within 2 minutes of ordering.  It's hot and fresh. They have the grill setup on the sidewalk so while you are waiting in line you get to smell the meats cooking.  Further enticing you with Chandos goodness.<br><br>There is a seating area in behind the trailer like structure, but with the noise from the cars going past, it's not overly quiet or cozy.  <br><br>Prices are really reasonable and you get a substantial amount of food for your dollar.  I'm not into quantity, and would prefer less if it was better tasting.  Chandos does both quality and quantity.  <br><br>I think that they try to keep the homeless people away from the customers, but due to the number of homeless people in the area, you usually get asked upon arriving or departing.  Seeing as the prices are very reasonable, I've frequently ordered an extra meal and then given it to someone in need, which is probably not helping the situation, but I know it helps out the recipient.<br><br>There is no atmosphere to this place, but food is fabulous.  5 Stars for food, 4 for wait time and location.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bQq_MDhKtTCh9xZsttBV8A

Chando’s Tacos,"Granite Bay, CA",11/29/2016,5,"This place is fire! I've had my fare share of tacos in Sacramento, and Chando's is pretty special. I ordered the three soft chicken tacos, and it was so good I ended up ordering more. When it comes down to it, Chando's has such a wide selection of options to order from, I couldn't resist. The guacamole and salsa was also to die for. I had always seen the taco trucks all over Sac, but I finally decided to just go in and try it out for myself. This place is amazing. There are only a hand full of different taco places in Sac worth going to, and Chando's is one of them. <br><br>As soon as I entered into the place, the smell made me excited. It's hard to like the food your about to eat if it doesn't smell amazing. The tacos are obviously phenomenal, which is quite apparent when you see how many people are in line waiting for their order. You can certainly judge a restaurant entirely off how many returning customers they have. Chando's is at the top in my opinion.<br><br>I was pleasantly surprised to see how low the prices were for the tacos. The tacos weren't like  ""taco bell cheap"", but the taste of the food exceeded what they were charging, which is always a good thing. There may be many different Mexican restaurants to go to in Sacramento, but Chando's for the price, taste, and customer experience is the best above a lot of different competitors. Everyone who eats out will want to know there going to the best place to eat. You will never have to worry with this place, there fantastic.

Chando’s Tacos,"Bakersfield, CA",5/13/2018,2,"After reading several of the over 1600 reviews, I thought how can I go wrong?  I was sorely dissappointed with my order of 4 carne asada tacos and a chicken torta. Let me start with the tacos, I opened the nice display box to find 4 paper separated tacos layed lovingly inside the box. I immediately noticed a sheen of grease reflecting back to me under the overhead light. I tried to pick up my first taco but the soaked and flacid cold tortillas fell apart in my hand before I could get it to my mouth.  I managed to get a portion into my mouth and bite down and was rewarded with a slap to the face of fatty grease laden steak that lacked any sort of seasoning or other reason to enjoy the bite I had just taken. I immediately spit the first bite out and back into the box, I thought to myself ok things can happen so let's try it again. I took another bite and.... well it was only remotely better and didn't invite the same reaction as the first so I continued on to finish the $1.99 taco with only 3 more noticeably  fatty pieces thru-out the taco that I spat out. I decided ok let's try another to see if the first was a bad one. The result was more of the same. I couldn't even stomach to eat the last 2 tacos and man I love tacos so it genuinely made my heart ache to throw those in the trash. After the taco debacle I switched gears and turned to the chicken torta, I noticed immediately a huge piece of bread with a rather small amount of filling inside. I picked up the sandwich and had a bite only to be rewarded with the tart taste of what I believe was something burnt inside, I'm not sure what it was but it sent my taste buds running. I excused it and had a drink of my beer and tried again. After the second bite with the same reward I dumped the entire contents of the sandwich onto my plate and tried to sort out the horrid taste. Turns out it was mostly the bread that started the bad taste but after I disposed of it I continued to try and eat the contents. The chicken itself didn't lend any favors to the overall taste and or especially the texture as a lot of it was on the mushy side and lacked that spicy flavor that I expect from a chicken torta.  I would give this place a lower rating but I feel like it was maybe just a bad day? With all the previous reviews I just can't imagine this happening before but as they say buyer beware and I would suggest to anyone to maybe sample what you want to order in advance.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=VOX0mXh_MKSj1zuq2m-jSg

Ordering at the window is easy, quick, and efficient. <br><br>I recommend my favorites: Carne asada tacos, Carne asada nachos, and Cochinita tacos. Very savory and fulfilling as they do top everything with guacamole. The nachos are a must have! Their nachos hit everything on the checklist that other places lack - plenty of guacamole, nacho cheese (which eliminates cheese going stale), pico de gallo, fresh made tortilla chips, and goes great with their salsas.

As I passed it, I thought, THAT MUST BE CHANDO'S!! I made a u turn and manuevered my way to a parking spot in the tight little lot. I have been wanting to try this place FOR-EVER. So I took a spot in line on the sidewalk among the other hungry lunchtime peeps. It was incredibly hot yesterday so thankfully they had misters going along the whole outside of the building. I waited only about 10 short minutes. It went by fast as I expected it to take much longer. I was worried for a moment that they may only take ca$h but NO..the cashier  had a square card reader hooked up to a cell phone! Not only was she super quick but quite charming!! I ordered a veggie taco, a carne asade taco and a side of chips and pico. Again, waited only about 5 minutes for the tacos while I snacked on my chips and pico del gallo. The chips were ok....nothing special or unique I thought. ***I really apprecitated that she asked me if I wanted cheese on my veggie taco!! I don't eat cheese since giving up dairy products last year. It wasn't listed on the menu so nice to be asked***<br><br>Once I got my order I practically ran to my nearby car in the parking lot that i had been pre-cooling with the air conditioner due to the 100+ degree temperature. <br>I took of my blouse...hey, hey...just to make sure i didn't spill any salsa on my work blouse. So there I sat in my summer camisole, air conditiong blowing full blast,  chowing down on some amazing tacos!!! I definately should have skipped the chips and ordered 2 more tacos. The carne asada was so flavorful and juicy. The onions and peppers in the veggie taco had just the right amount of char from the grill. Each taco was perfectly topped with guacamole. <br><br>Glad I can add finally trying Chando's Tacos to my list of things I did in the summer of 2015. See you soon Chando!!

Their asada was beyond what I expected; I was in love-for the moment. Haha. The chorizo is very flavorful, lightly salty but not to the point where I won't order it again. The torta, oh man, it is made with perfection! The buns (?) are fresh &amp; crunchy. The amount of meat and veggies added are perfect! Now onto the burrito... I'm not a big fan of the lettuce in my burrito or the fact that there's no rice in it either?! What the heck... Did they forget or does it just come like that? However, the burrito doesn't lack in flavor at all. It's just different. I wouldn't order it again. Also, if you order their hot salsa on the side, warning, it is spicy! So beware. Other than that, fantastic job Chandos! I'm happy that I finally got to try your tacos (:<br><br>Area: Very small parking lot. I'd say about 4-6 parking spots total? So if it's busy, you'll have to look for street parking! There is also a little patio behind the ""restaurant"" that you can eat at, which is pretty cool. They also announce your name through an intercom so don't worry about not hearing your name. Good luck yelpers!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=akBq_E9acEKaNubl5gwrmw

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",1/21/2014,5,"My vote for best street tacos in Sacramento? CHAAAAANom-nom-nomDOOOOO'S!<br><br>I discovered Chando's (and by discovered, I mean my friend screamed ""You haven't had Chando's!?"" and dragged me towards their truck) at SactoMoFo and fell in love. Lil street tacos that are small in price and HUGE in flavor, what's not to like? After many passionate flings with their food truck, I finally made it out to their taco stand. I was blown away by how many meat options are on their menu! <br>(Totally random: I love the dancey Mexican music playing overhead while we were in line. Finally, a valid excuse to dance my nerdy white girl rumpshaker dance while standing on a sidewalk! ;D)<br>I got the taco combo, which is 3 tacos and a drink for $6. Between the two of us we got adobada, asada, carnitas, chorizo and chicken in taco and torta form. The mealy texture of the chorizo threw me off, but everything tasted freaking delicious. $20 (actually less than $20) got us a metric mess of food.<br><br>If I could beg one favor from Chando's it would be to somehow label which tacos are which; we had 9 tacos and some of the meats look really similar.

But with the exception of a sincere apology through Yelp from the restaurant, I was finally willing to give this place a second chance! My hubby got a carne asada quesadilla which was exceptionally delicious and I got 3 tacos for myself - pork and chicken. Unfortunately I was only able to take one bite of the quesadilla before he scarfed the rest down in a matter of minutes. Though from what I remember, there was a slight crunch as I bit into the quesadilla that was filled with a warm center of steak, cheese and grilled onions. The tacos were succulent with the juices dripping down after each bite. The meat and pork was very flavorful and well marinated.<br><br>This tiny roadside shack is as authentic as it can get in the Sacramento area; there's no other restaurant that can top this place off! It looks like there has been a few renovations since my last visit - new paint job along with a built-in covered patio in the seating area.  <br><br>This place will not disappoint!

My favorite of the batch that I got was definitely the carnitas. <br><br>They have a grill right outside, so the whole area smells like deliciousness, but just be prepared that the smell will linger, and everyone will know what you had for lunch today",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=LRqQiuBvA4TDyyCtbeGjDQ
Chando’s Tacos,"San Francisco, CA",3/23/2014,5,"Whenever I go to a Sactomofo event, I love getting tacos at Chando's Taco! They are pretty good! I wanted to get some at Sactomofo, but the line was rediculously long! Its alright though. So my girlfriend and I decided to try the actual location on Arden. When we got there, there was a decent line. I was thinking, ""You when a place is poppin' when there is a line and a crowd."" The parking lot was full, but we park in the residential area. I was worried that they had limited seating, however they had a spacious area in the back. <br><br>Overall, I love their tacos. I gotta try the burrito or nachos next time.

Its hard to put into words how delicious the food from this little taco stand is, you simply must go out and try it for yourself in order to understand how good it is. They cook all of their meats fresh on the grill right next to the counter and the smell of carne and pollo asada on the grill is downright intoxicating! <br><br>My favorite menu item thus far is the quesadilla. It is stuffed full of gooey warm cheese, your choice of meat (I usually go pollo asada), cilantro, guacamole, onions, and pico de gallo. You won't believe how much food you are getting for $5.50, this quesadilla is almost big enough for two. <br><br>When I don't order the quesadilla I get the Chando's combo, 3 tacos + a drink for $7. I usually go for the pollo asada, carne asada, and ensenada (breaded fish). <br><br>No order is complete without a few of their DELICIOUS tacos de papa (hard shelled potato tacos), make sure you order 2-3 tacos de papa per person in your dining group.<br><br>Last but not least be sure to try their MULITAS.

What I really love are the quesadillas and mulitas, which are basically the same thing, just using different tortillas. When eating the quesadilla (which is huge, filling, and loaded), I can't help but notice the half inch of FAT that this thing expels virtually every time I pick it up. <br><br>Now, when looking at your own reflection in this deep, rich puddle of grease, you can think about it two ways: ""Oh my god, I can't believe I am actually eating that"" OR ""Wow! I am so glad I am NOT eating that"". Get it? <br><br>Pro-tip: ask for a side of their habanero sauce. <br><br>Bottom line: I am a fan. They are super nice people. I don't like their tacos.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=QIFw7TSotB1g7gFGDGMDUA

Chando’s Tacos,"San Francisco, CA",1/8/2015,4,"First time I came here was with Gabe N. Of course, with his recommendation I expected great food!  Chando's did not disappoint :) <br><br>Really great tacos! Nice and flavorful, with a great selection of different types of meat. I personally love getting lengua in my tacos, but the last time I was there, it smelled like they were grilling some bomb-ass chicken. So I'll probably try that next time. The only gripe I have with the tacos is the price. $1.85 for a taco...it hits the wallet hard :( And it's not like they're extraordinarily big either. But once in a while, Chando's is worth the splurge!<br><br>Burritos are also really great and hit the spot when you have that craving. I had a burrito from Chando's and then a burrito from another place the next day...dang that second burrito tasted so bland. It's about $6 for a burrito, which is average. However, the size will not impress. It is a good size and will leave you contently full, but don't expect anything too huge.<br><br>Also, try their horchata! I love horchata, but usually it's too grainy for my taste. However, Chando's horchata is significantly smoother than places I've tried it at. It's got a good kick of cinnamon, so you have been warned.<br><br>Luckily, there is a seating area in the back, despite the streetside location. It's kind of dingy, but hey, all you want to do is eat the burrito and bounce, right? There's also a small parking lot off to the side of the restaurant, which is also really useful. But if you come during a rush, expect to look for parking on nearby streets. When you're there, you most likely will have to wait in line. Kind of agonizing because they always have a delicious-smelling meat on the grill. It sure builds up the appetite!<br><br>YES, I would recommend to people :)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=HZ24oVTVz9_2gN1RviAJ1w

Yo no quiero Taco Bell! <br><br>Did a Yelp search on ""tacos"" close to work and lo and behold, Chando's pops up. Hurrying to my sorry Honda (hey, it's paid for), I zoomed over and found this cute taco shack off the beaten path of Arden Way.  <br><br>For $1.75 you have a choice of meats including lengua - which if my Spanish doesn't fail me - is a cow part that would've tasted you at one point. I stuck with pork in adoba sauce, chicken with anchiote spices and steak marinated in carne asada spices. You can get a combo deal for $6 (plus tax) for all three and it comes with a drink. I don't do soda, so I got the three which came to $5.71 with tax. Agua fresca is another option at $1.90. Bonus points for takeaway in a cardstock box instead of styrofoam.  <br><br>Don't come here for the ambiance, unless you like looking at a weed-choked Valero station across busy dusty Arden Way. The tables are well-kept, the place is super clean and the service is customer-oriented. They even promoted Yelp on their menu.

Swapping out the fountain drink for horchata totaled to $8.01. For taco filling, I got the birria (goat), adobada (steak), and carnitas (pork). The filling is a little skimpy in portion and the horchata is a bit grainy. I really enjoyed the birria, which was juicy and flavorful. There is quite a bit of seating in their back patio (has heat lamps), but most people seemed to be getting takeout.

The flavor of the meat was good, you can tell it was cooked right. But, all of our tacos were cold, not even a little warm.

After over a year here in Sac, I've was able to finally try this place recently. Unlike everything else on Arden, this place is located on the other side of Arden. What stuck out right when I got here is a red/yellow color scheme which screams for attention. In addition, this place is an enlarged taco stand, with a grill full of meat being cooked. <br><br>As for the food itself, the tacos cost a little more than what I'm used to. The tacos come with some onions, cilantro, spicy green sauce. I ended up getting the Chando's Combo (3 tacos + drink for $6). I chose carnitas and carne asada to be safe and lengua for the third. The lengua meat could've been seasoned a little more and really relied on the condiments. As for the carnitas and carne asada, I was a little disappointed with the carnitas. Both the carnitas and carne asada tasted pretty much the same. Both had a good amount of flavors and were pretty moist. However, both meats were a bit on the salty end. Fortunately, they also serve radishes with your tacos.<br><br>All in all, this was a solid taco spot but a bit overrated. There's outdoor seating behind the actual restaurant. The seating area is covered up so you can still enjoy you meal outside. There's little actual parking, though there's an area that's full of rocks that can be used for parking also.

When he guaranteed that I'd like it by offering to pay for my lunch if I didn't, it was on!  <br><br>Opted for individual tacos so I could try a beef (birria), carne asada and the pork adobada. I don't remember what Rod, the cab driver got because once I started in on my tacos, I didn't stop until they were all gone. <br><br>The meats were all marinated and cooked to perfection. Nothing tough. Nothing burnt. Nothing undercooked. The tacos were full of flavor and the portion sizes were just right for the price - just under $2 each. <br><br>It's like a food stand.

Where's the al pastor, or the grilled Mexican onions, the various salsas, etc... Also, for an $8 price tag this was seriously the smallest burrito I've ordered in my entire life for that price. Literally wanted to go to taco Bell, buy their classic burrito supreme for size comparison.. they use shredded white cheese and a bunch of sour cream.. again, just Uber americanized.. I feel for this area I expect authentic.. this was not that... Their nachos looked like ones you can buy at a sporting event.. with nacho cheese sauce... No thank you.

They toast the tortilla which I LOVE. I usually get a chicken or asada burrito, but they have a LOT of different meats to choose from.

My husband has a giant boner for this place and I've often had to endure his end-of-the-day tales of what he and his co-worker had for lunch at Chando's. I finally folded and joined him &amp; father in-law for lunch there.<br> <br>Perfectly spiced meats grilling right out front is a tempting invitation for sure. They have a 3 taco + drink special for $6, but I was only a little hungry (my bad!) and opted for 2 fish tacos. These street-style tacos (@ $1.75 ea) came with grilled fish, the traditional cream sauce, plus a spicy red sauce and shredded cabbage. We sat out back on the covered patio surrounded by bamboo and I don't recall any conversation once we got our food, maybe except for ""Mmmm!"" and the husband, ""Good, huh!"" <br><br>This will definitely be a regular spot for us and I can't wait to introduce others to it.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Kl_duVO3SjvNNgTv2LM6bA
Chando’s Tacos,"Central LA, Los Angeles, CA",2/14/2012,4,"This was our pick for Valentine's day lunch. What the eating area (a fenced, garage-y gathering of metal tables and chairs) lacks in romance, it makes up for in tacotasticness. <br><br>I recommend the Chando's special: 3 tacos and a drink (with free refills if you can stand to wait in line or beg someone to let you cut and curry the cashier's favor) for $6. Throw in pico and chips for an extra $1. I dare you to find a fresher cheaper lunch in all of Sacramento. (If you do - tell me!)<br><br>The clear winner is the adobada (spicy pork); it's good enough to write home about. Fish is also delectable. In all honesty, the carnitas can be a little hit or miss (sometimes bland, but always tender). <br><br>Enjoy!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=moRhE1fQ_vC6F13uaneirw

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",1/6/2014,5,"Wicked wait times and dangerous as all hell location: Next to Arden Way speedway.... But they appear to totally digg Yelp so that's a good sign ;)~<br><br>^^^ My check in commentary as I waited in a substantial line at 7'ish in the evening this past week....<br><br>Now I see why so many people love Chando's as I finally got the chance to experience it myself....<br> <br>FLAVOR, FRESHNESS and lastly Flavor even though I know I already said it. All three different items I inhaled were full of flavor from start to finish. And although I do drown my Mexican food in cup size portions of sour cream the flavor was still amazing and not at all over powered by my sour cream fetish.... <br><br>I'd say the negative to this location is the less than desirable busy street~side location of it as its literally on the industrial/business end of Arden Way and the freeway entrance/exits and the lack of parking. One single gravely area that allows for and this is a rough guesstimate but I'd say maybe 5-6 cars at any one time? I didn't let that stop me and parked my gynormous rigg on a straight gravel area not designated for parking and made getting out a lil tricky but it was worth it.... <br><br>Even with the line of 10+ people already in front of me I have to say that the line did move damn fast and I was in and out of there with exactly the order I paid for in around 25 minutes or so... <br><br>Here's what I got: <br><br>TACOS: $1.75 each or 3/$6 and they throw in a beverage for the 3/$6 deal. I opted for 2 each of their chicken and 2 of the Carne Asada. They were both fantastically flavored, cooked, plated beautifully and had ample amounts of fillings that were all very fresh including the sides of radish and wedges of lime... <br><br>Soft taco shells: a new experience for me super soft, super fresh and two in each taco which held the guts of it together beautifully.<br><br>My favorite was the chicken although the Asada is definitely in the top 2 for Sacramento for me thus far... They grill it somehow and that's what helps to make it so yummy BUT their chicken was delicious and seasoned to perfection..... The fresh guacamole that topped the tacos was plentiful and fresh... Wish I had some for lunch right now actually.... <br><br>BURRITO: They don't serve super sized burritos here I learned but have to say that the size of their regular burrito was close to a super sized burrito and affordable at right around $6 bucks...<br><br>Customer Service is excellent. From the order taker who was swamped but still found time to engage me in sincere conversation to the dude who called my order ready and made sure I had all that I needed before departing........ <br><br>I loved Chando's food and I know that there is more than one location but this location even if it is dangerous as all hell due to the insane traffic whizzing by you as you wait is so worth it!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=UJ7LihYpiTUgza2e9Dj6aQ
Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",5/9/2016,2,"Convenience got this place two stars. I can make better Mexican at home! I don't know what's up with the reviews on Sacramento restaurants and them being praised for having good food, because I can't even count five spots in town that are worth a drive and the cost.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",12/18/2011,3,"I wasn't nearly as impressed with this place as I had built myself up to be. After reading countless reviews praising Chando's for their simple Mexican fare, you can imagine my excitement when my gal suggested we go here for lunch.<br><br>Hopefully you can also imagine my disappointment. The meat was well-seasoned (especially the asada) and the tacos cheap, but they weren't worth the headache of trying to find a spot to park then waiting in a long line and standing out on the curb with traffic whizzing by for 15 minutes. I killed time munching on tasteless tortilla chips and unremarkable pico de gallo. They also completely screwed up my girlfriend's order - twice - and left her standing at the window trying to explain the difference between a taco and a tostada to two different people. <br><br>I've heard a lot of praise about how cheap and affordable their food is, but cheap alone doesn't cut it. Finding good inexpensive Mexican food in the Sacramento region isn't hard, and I'm willing to pay a little more for a taco if it means less of a headache trying to get that taco in the first place. <br><br>The tacos were great and I will return to try them again. But based on this experience alone I can only give them three stars. Chando's loyalists: I am prepared for your wrath.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=o5STsEtfvD1Ig0J7Z-1uxA

Chando’s Tacos,"Hilliard, OH",10/6/2015,4,"THIS PLACE WAS INCREDIBLE! I was visiting my husband from Ohio while he was on business in Cali. I found this place and it was one of the best burritos I have had. I had a chicken burrito, special, and the hot sauce they gave with it was to die for. The chicken itself was marinated in some juice and bursting with flavor! My husband had the adobido (I might be misspelling that) pork and he devoured his burrito in 5 minutes. The only thing that could have been improved was the guac because it seemed just a little bit watery and could have used a little bit of garlic salt. Other than that, it was FABULOUS.

If you have never had a street taco this is a fairly safe option to try one.<br><br>The basics: I've been hearing people rave about this place since I moved to Sac and I eventually had to try it. I happened to be down the street and saw this on my way somewhere else to grab lunch so I stopped in. It is a little and tiny place that you will miss unless you are either looking for it or stumble on it like I did. The lines went from nonexistent to really long while I was there enjoying my grub. The tacos were inexpensive and pretty good. I wouldn't say they were my favorite street tacos I've ever had, but they were damn good. I could personally have gone for a little more seasoning and kick to mine, but maybe that was just my menu choice.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",11/12/2014,4,"Chando's Tacos is their name...making delicious tacos is their game! This place is definitely in a weird location I will start with that. It is over the bridge on Arden; a couple minutes passed the mall. I almost feel like this place would make a lot more a killing on the mall side of the bridge due to the larger availability of parking. Yes there is a lot split in two fro cars but it is very minimal. Street parking is available but it can get filled fairly quickly in peak hours. However, we aren't here to talk about parking or engineering; we're here for food!<br><br>Probably one of the best highlights of this place is that every taco comes with guacamole! That should be awesome in anyone's book. Now don't be disappointed when you imagine a thick clumpy glob of guac on top of your tacos. Their style is more creamy and smooth so it doesn't get everywhere and block out all the flavor of the meat you ordered with it. This place does have a Wide selection of meat to choose from as well which is another plus. I myself ordered the three tacos combo to begin with one chicken (pollo), steak (carne asada), &amp; the last pork (adobada). I gotta say out of the three, the adobada was my favorite. The spices and flavors that Chando's creates is an amazing blend that keeps my mouth watering for more! <br><br>This leads to my first con with Chando's; the tacos are too small. I am not saying they are tiny, but rather they didn't quite fill me up like I wanted. Like any other person would--I went back for more! Two more to be exact but after those I was quite satisfied. The only other con I had was that there were a weird amount of flies roaming about in the patio area. However, this is only a minor nuisance considering how cheap my bill was after ordering my food. <br><br>I will for sure return to consume one of the other items Chando's offers and see how they compare.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=emUTbX-l8M5W2M7_nEOZ4Q

Today I used my other name, ""Isá"". After returning a few times to the window seeing if they called my name because they always pronounce my middle name in weird ways (lol), but the dude was a jerk with my name and made fun of it. Maybe call people by numbers so we can pick our food with confidence knowing that order to belongs to me. Also, the tortillas in my tacos were cold, a minute after receiving the order they would break by half when folding the taco (its what happens when you don't heat them up, Mexican experience with tortillas here).

Chando’s Tacos,"Union City, CA",10/7/2011,5,"Believe it or not,  there was a random chihuahua roaming for food the first night I visited. He was there on his own free will, too. Yo quiero... okay, I'll stop. <br><br>It was 9:30pm on a Saturday, and a friend and I just finished satisfying our fall shopping urge at the Rack. Where to eat? Chando's was bookmarked in my Yelp app and still open with 30 minutes to spare! <br><br>Like moths to a flame, we gravitated toward the brightly lit taco stand. Walking up to Chando's, we were delighted to see a grill outside where the meats were freshly cooked! Loooved it. There were only two couples ahead of us. I ordered my three tacos (fish, adobada and chicken) and she, her two tacos and mulita. During our short 5 minute wait, we jokingly plotted on how to snatch the meat off the grill when the cook wasn't looking. (He goes inside to grab something, leaving the meat unattended. We run up and pick several pieces off but end up dropping the piping hot meat on the ground and running away with empty burnt hands... while cackling.)<br><br>Both being new to the place, we peered into our boxes and frowned at the size of our spoils but rejoiced at the warm aromas. Stay and eat or go to my place? Eating on the balcony while sipping on wine in our comfy sweaters sounds like perfection, right? Although we feared soggy and cold food, we braved the 5-10 minute drive back to my place.  They sent us off with a smile and off we went with my car smelling of spices which made me salivate.<br><br>Considering Chando's uses fresh ingredients, wine and tacos aren't such an odd pairing. We were both amazed at how flavorful, filling and ridiculously well-priced everything was (not to mention still warm). The size of these tacos were quite deceiving! They don't skimp on meat, people. I didn't feel like my insides were coated in grease, either.  <br><br>We laughed and talked, sipped and devoured. It was a good night and Chando's Tacos had a huge part in making it that way.<br><br>Since then, I've also tried the birria and carne asada tacos. Although I really do love 'em all, I'd say my personal top two are the birria and fish (tilapia). I've tried some of my bf's carne asada burrito, and it was so damn good. As others have mentioned, the burrito is filled simply with meat and veggies. The $1 chips and pico is a steal, but although I did like the pico, the chips didn't taste like they were fried in fresh oil. Maybe just a bad batch.<br><br>During the day, eating on their patio listening to upbeat  music can be a treat, but beware the flies. It was almost difficult to savor my meal when I was being harassed by those pesky things. And seriously, I showered.    <br><br>But chips and flies are small details when it comes down to it. Its main staples are great and I'll continue to eat and recommend Chando's Tacos time and time again.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=cgieSZZ2cHb7sYUZchlgSQ

I guess that is the perfect time because there was no line! I was very happy I wouldn't have to end up standing in the rain. The person who took my order was really nice. I ordered the adobada quesadilla. I ordered this based on a review I read that the quesadilla was really cheesey, but was disappointed to find that was not so. The quesadilla was still good though. It was rather huge and I wasn't able to finish it. I want to go back and try their tacos with the different meats.

Obviously, hot Sacramento summer + no air conditioning is a nightmare, but the great food is soooo worth it. I had the carne asada, carnitas, pollo, adobada, and all of them were amazing.

Its Basically a quesadilla stacked on top of itself using two shells instead of folded like a taco. <br><br>They have an extensive list of meats and heard some people talking about the Adovada so decided to try it and was blown away. I love hot sauce and usually drench about anything i can in it but truth be told I barely sprinkled any on my order because the flavors of the meats i had were too good to be covered up. <br><br>Don't be dissuaded by the lack of street parking there's a big lot in the back plus an eating area that I would have never seen until I decided to drive out the back.

My only complaint is that the chips that came with the chips + pico were stale, definitely not worth it. I've also heard the nachos here aren't great since they use the fake cheese.

Chando’s Tacos,"West Sacramento, CA",9/21/2016,1,"I ordered one of each kind of taco and boy was I disapointed. The potato one was really good, but the other kinds where so bad and dry. The guacamole overpowered the meat in the tacos. I also ordered a chicken torta. The chicken was overcooked, and they chop it into tiny little pieces, and there was hardly any meat on the bun. They put a quarter size smear of the guacomole on the bottom bun. There was no onion and no tomato on the sandwich. There was only a little lettuce on the sandwich that was hard to see because there was so little of it. The bun was really good thank god, because I paid seven dollars for it. I went back a couple of days later for the potato tacos and of course it was bad. It had hardly any potato in it and a few strands of cabbage, and the tortia was so overcookes that it was cracking and falling apart.

It was definitely fulfilling, but very small. Second, they used a lot of salsa. This usually isn't an issue for me, but every bite I took made the salsa juice go everywhere.

I barely made it. and I ordered a few tacos, a Torta (never had a torta before) and burrito. I actually met the owner we got to talking and he told me that his father used to own a tortilla factory in Mexico and that all of his ingredients are fresh, He gets his tortillas once a week and they're locally made and he buy the bread for the tortas daily. While I was there a patron complained about the limited menu compared to Betos. While it's true that the menu is somewhat limited, this place does their food right it's fresh, simple, and most important tasty.<br><br>So I bring the food over to my friend's house I start eating  The tortas are pretty bad ass, I've never had a torta before, but it was MAGNIFICENT!!! The bread was slightly crunch/chewy, the adobada was salty and savory. The one thing I like about this place is that it's simple, tasty, and Fresh. <br><br>So I'm eating my Torta and my friend sees it and literally yanks it out of my hand and takes a bite immediately after he take two more bites. I originally was going to give this place 4.5 stars, but I found out that my friend went there the next day to get a torta so I upped it to 5.<br><br>The Birria burrito was delicious, it has a nice heft to it and was very flavorful. They  Meats they have are Pork Adobada, Steak Carne Asada, Chicken, Fish, Spicy Beef Stew meat, Chorizo, Carnitas (tends to run out), Tripe(stomach lining what you find in menudo), and Tounge. <br><br>The only bad thing is that everytime I hear that song on the Radio, I'm thinking man I could use a Taco right now.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DuBxGulKTyIN8kDzH_LUsw

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",9/11/2010,5,"I love street tacos and when I saw that Chando's Tacos was hot on yelp I had to check it out! My gf and I stopped by here on the way home and ordered Chando's combo, recommended by Chando himself, which is 3 tacos and a drink for about $6.50. Very surprised and comforted to know that they accept Visa and MC being they're a small operation. Smart move by the owner knowing that they're not close to any major establishments to get cash fast!<br><br>I ordered the carne asada and my gf had the fish (tilapia) with a side of pico and chips.The pico had a decent heat to it which wasn't to the point to make you gulp half your drink after a few chips, but I like mine a little more spicy. Service here is fast and courteous! The tacos came out fresh and they are not shy on the meat and toppings. The carne asada was seasoned perfectly like it had been marinating all day and was very tender (no fatty chewy pieces). You can add hot sauce if you like, but I think these tacos have just enough heat by themselves. My gf loved her fish tacos and was happy that she could order them any way she wanted without having to pay extra! The tacos weren't drenched in grease and they're easy to eat. I have to add that these tacos were so damn good that before I could finish the last one I ordered 3 more! lol <br><br>I really enjoyed the food and the service too! My gf and I didn't realize we were being helped by Chando himself until after we thanked him for the food and introduced ourselves! He's a great guy and seems to be very passionate about what he does. Good company too! He'll make you feel at home and comfortable while you're there. Even though they accept credit/debit cards for payment I am willing to get cash before coming here in respect to the business. <br><br>Try out Chando's Tacos for yourself and see what you think. They also have tortas and burritos here too, but I'd start with the tacos. Chando also has specially made t-shirts from the stand itself if you want to represent the business!<br><br>*UPDATE* Visit #2<br>I came back to Chando's after one day with my gf and this time decided to try the tortas!<br><br>Great personal service again by Chando! He even remembered my name and thanked my gf for the Yelp review she made for him!<br><br>Carne asada again on the torta and the gf ordered a fish torta (she doesn't eat meat). I don't know what kind of bread he uses on these tortas, but it's amazing! It was nice and crispy and since the meat isn't all greasy it didn't make the bread soggy and gross by the end of the meal (very important to me)! <br><br>This was another great visit to Chando's Tacos and it won't be the last!

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",9/6/2012,4,"My first time at this place, I went around 7:30PM when there was literally no line. I've driven by this place many times during the day and contemplated stopping by but the line was very unattractive. So one day I decided to go more towards the evening when there were no lines. I went with Chando's asada tacos but were also curious about their burritos. The tacos were delicious. The meat was very well marinated and had tons of flavor if you have them put all the toppings on it. The guacamole was fresh and green with the cilantro and onions not being too overpowered by the guacamole. Tacos are simple and very inexpensive. Although the chips were fresh and were quite hard to chop on, as compared to let say Chipotle and the salsa has too large of tomato chunks. I ordered my tacos to go but was not given any hot sauce nor asked if I wanted hot sauce. At the time when I ordered they had already put away the hot sauce station. When it comes to reviewing taco shops, I don't base my reviews on simply how they cook their meat and how well the dice their veggies to throw it all together to make a taco/burrito. My best experiences with mexican food comes through with chips, salsa, and hot sauce. Tacos and burritos alone doesn't do it for me. <br><br>The menu is largely plastered in chalk next to the order window which makes it easy to order and decide on what you want. The $6 three tacos and a drink makes ordering simple, especially if its your first time there and not wanting to spend too much. Its one thing to spend a lot of money its another to spend it on something you're not sure would satisfy your hunger.<br><br>The place is a small shack with patio seating in the back. The parking space is a rocky unpaved lot but street parking is also available. When busy I'm sure it'll fill up pretty quick.

Chando’s Tacos,"Orangevale, CA",4/22/2015,1,"The only reason I am giving Chando's 1 star is because 0 is not an option. We had them do catering for a school event for us. The catering coordinator was extremely difficult to get a hold of and was not helpful in getting us the basic information we needed (such as catering prices). When we finally picked up our order, food was soggy, cold and we were missing several orders. We had to send someone back to Chando's a second time to get the rest of the orders, but again were missing several. We ended up paying money for orders that we never received. Some teachers never got their lunches and some who did got it an hour late because of the mix up. So disappointing as this was supposed to be a rare once-a-year treat for the teaching staff at a disadvantaged school. We will never use them again.

Have been going there faithfully since the opening, present at the 1 year anniversary, raved about them to bring new customers,and ate there faithfully, spent lots of money, and gained lots of weight from the tacos and burritos.!! However, I went there one night, and the cooks were in the middle of cooking and cleaning. When my ticket was printed, the man went from washing dishes, and cleaning the wall near the vent, and with my ticket put his dirty  hands in the cheese mixing it to proceed to make my quesadilla. I told the cashier what I saw, and instead of just washing his hands he denied it, became upset, and begin to speak Spanish. He refused to wash his hands and simply asked for my money back, which I did get and never been there again! The owner, young Hispanic male appears to be real nice along with some of the other employees are nice. I hope time would be taken to devote to customer service,and safe food handling  and health conditions. Before my last visit I also noticed Sometimes there were alot of flies in the kitchen which concerned me before and those days in the past I wouldnt order and just leave.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",10/15/2012,4,"Let's be honest... you can't throw a rock and not hit a taco stand in this town. With that said, anyone who opens up shop and slings tacos has a lot of competition and needs to stand out of the crowd. Chando's does that and more.<br><br>You'll most likely encounter a line at this taco stand on Arden Way that leads out to the side walk. If the line isn't too long, you'll get you fresh tacos or other fair pretty quickly. But, if you roll up during lunch, dinner or almost any other time, you will wait a bit and get your fresh tacos... and trust me, the wait is worth it.<br><br>When evaluating a good taco, there are three elements to take into consideration. First is the tortilla. Most over look this important vehicle, but a bad tortilla will ruin any decent taco experience to be had. Chando's delivers with fresh corn tortillas, almost as if they were fresh off the griddle. They maybe small, yet they do their job.<br><br>The second is the filling. This shapes the direction of your taco. Chando's delivers many choices, and the few that stand out are the carne asada, pollo, fish and carnitas to just name a few. Each taco is packed with the filling of your choice and all four of the above are well seasoned. <br><br>The third and final element is the produce and the sauce. I want to know that they onions and cilantro are chopped fresh, and they are. I want to know that my salsa or guac is made fresh on site, and it is. The right sauce with the right filling completes the perfect taco experience, and Chando's delivers every time!<br><br>So, why only four stars? Chando's has a limited menu, which I love. The few items that I have tried other than the tacos (burrito, mulitas and quesadilla), are good (fresh ingredients and flavorful meat) but they didn't do a whole lot for me.

The line moves quickly and there's a decent amount of parking around back. I recommend the chando combo. You get three tacos (mix and match) and a drink for 6 dollars and some change. All of the tacos are good but my favorite are chicken, carne asada, and cochinita pibil. Go crazy. Try them all.

I went with 3 other people and we all opted for the tacos. They have a vast selection of meats to choose from. Each of the steak, chicken, and fish tacos were delicious. They were definitely different from your chained flour tortilla joints. The corn tortillas along with their own fresh Pico n Chile verde gives it an amazing flavor.<br><br>The prices for this place are a little higher than that of a chain restaurant but the food served here is well worth the extra couple of bucks.

The meats are scooped from trays precooked but haven't been sitting for ever on end, but not fresh off the grill as you would expect in Mexico. Taste isn't bad. I got a fish mulita, and for tacos the carnitas, asada, adobada, and birria. The mulita asada and birria was dripping with fluid from the precooked trays but did keep the meats from drying out. Birria seemed a little like mystery meat that will require flossing. Good flavor in the adoba and carnitas.

I found a table and enjoyed feeling like I was somewhere back in Cabo with mexican music playing and vegetation around . 10 minutes later my food is ready. The burrito is stuffed with some legit chunks of lean, marinated, juicy steak. The burrito was also toasted on the outside, just the way I like it!

My first bite was hot lettuce!!!!!!!!! Who on earth puts lettuce in a freaking burrito that has hot items inside. I took another bite and had a mouth full of grease low grade jack cheese and something I think they call guacamole but was instead low grade sour cream mixed with one avocado in a blender.  The beans in the burrito were horrible and salty...

You don't really want to go before 10:30am for 2 reasons anyhow: <br>1: They aren't open til then, and <br>2: There is no indoor seating.  It gets mighty cold sitting at a lunch table before 10:30am.<br><br>The tacos are made to order on the spot!  I've tried most of the tacos but my personal fav is the carnitas tacos.  Flavorful and yummy, I could eat 3 on a hungry day!  (Think street tacos - not the fake corporate Taco Bell-ish ones you get at a drive thru smuck joint.)<br> <br>The only thing lacking here is good chips and salsa.  The chips taste like they are from Costco.  You know that cheap a@@ bag of chips that you can feed 300 people with?!  Yeah.

One thing that kind of disturbed me was I arrived around 8:45 PM and I noticed that someone was cleaning one of the two cooking grills by spraying chemicals and cleaning solutions at the same time they were cooking food on the other grill and mind you there right next to each other. I'm not sure that's the most sanitary way to do things, and I think they run the risk of getting chemicals on the food that's being prepared right next to where they're pouring water and spraying chemicals on the cooking surface to clean it.

The last time was this weekend and after driving by and not stopping 3 or 4 times because of the long lines since their Bee review on my way to La Victoria Mercado, I finally thought, what else have you go to do? I waited for 20 minutes to put in my order for a Chando's Special, 3 tacos (all fish) and a fountain drink for 6 bucks. I had a nice conversation with a guy from Elk Grove--so it went pretty quick--I told him if he likes Mexican food (I think he was Mexican-American) he needed to check out Lalo's. It took me maybe 6 minutes to devour the tacos--they are pretty small but tasty. The extra hot charred habanero salsa has a nice kick to it. <br><br>The bottom line is if you're out this way, and the line isn't too long, it's worth stopping.

Do you even know what these meats are suppose to taste like.  All I could taste in the asada was the seasoning, no asada flavor what so ever, just some after taste of fat that wasn't cleaned off the grill.  I like my asada tacos to taste like beef. I know that ""Arrachera"" (Skirt Steak ) is expensive but there are some other cuts of meats that make a good Asada tacos. <br><br>Al pastor was a major disappointment. It had a little too much Cumin for my taste, the closest thing I could compare this to was Carmelita's Brand Chorizo (which I actually like) but this was way off the mark.  Chando is better off naming it ""Chando's Meat"" cuz it tastes nothing Al Pastor.<br><br>And for the Carnitas, which he makes in ""Chando's Caso,""(Soon to be on Telemundo) which translates to ""Chando's Case"" explains the texture and flavor.  Traditional Carnitas need to be fried in a ""CAZO"", these Carnitas were like steamed.  If anyone thinks that they're ""off the hook"" you don't know Carnitas! If you have never been to the state of Michoacan(that's in Mexico by the way) and have had Carnitas at a ""Puesto""(a food stand), you wouldn't be disappointed, because simply you don't know Carnitas.  Those of us that have visited Mexico not ""Tijuana"" you'll feel violated and if you haven't had them here, save your money.  <br><br>I hate giving Chando his first 1 star review, but his food did nothing for me. Chando is succeeding in this tough economic times where others are failing,  so good job! So I close my first review in the immortal words of Bono, "" I still haven't found what I'm looking for.""",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Ocnwa_drkwxFih1JjRSCvw

Chando’s Tacos,"Walnut Creek, CA",4/26/2015,4,"As you can only have one first Yelp review it was only after careful consideration that I decided to devirginize myself by reviewing Chando's. <br><br>As a recent immigrant from the LA area finding a good taco place was one of my top priorities. I was litterally Yelping taco from the moving truck when I saw Chando's. At that time they had only 8 reviews with five stars and clearly 5 of the reviews were fake. (All five were new Yelp accounts and Chando's was their first review ... hmmmmmm...) I skipped Chando's that day in July and tried another place which isn't worth mentioning here. A couple weeks later I was wondering if I was ever going to find a really good taco in Sacramento. Now Chando's had gained several more reviews, all good, and all from real people. So I decided to give it a try. <br><br>There is a very pleasant lady who took my order. I informed her I had read about them on Yelp and was hoping they were as good as my favorite taco places back in LA. She immediately turns her head and yells ""Guys the taco inspector is here!"". I couldn't help but laugh and so I ordered one of each, except chicken. On subsequent visits she has always been there to take my order and has always been very pleasant. So what about the food? <br><br>In short, these tacos are legit. Everyone is going to have a slightly different preference. After several visits I prefer the pork with extra cilantro and onion. Their salsa is not very hot but if you ask they will give you some kind of habanero sauce in a little cup which definitely puts these tacos over the top. <br><br>Why only four stars if the tacos are so good? Simply put, I'm spoiled. Back in LA I can get the same thing for a dollar, with a restroom. If Yelp would allow it I would give 4.5 starts but I can't. <br><br>I highly recommend Chando's to you poor taco deprived Sacramento residents.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=FpNILLG8aZGOCs6rgfS-Pg

The entertainment was OK, it could have been better --- There was a group of people across the street in the abandoned Vallero lot screaming and yelling about nonsense, haha... <br><br>But nevertheless, it was packed. The meats were deliciously juicy. I had the tacos in carne asada, carnitas and chicken. They were very generous with the meat on the tacos.  All was good! Especially the carne asada. It was tender and juicy. My girlfriend thought the chicken was better, but women don't know what they are talking about to begin with, haha ;).. <br><br>The only complaints I have were: I just wished the hot sauce was more like a salsa.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",12/19/2013,4,"I've been hearing nothing but good stuff about this place since it was written up in the Sac Bee a few weeks ago. Being the true Californian that I am, any new Mexican food joint getting rave reviews is a place I want to go.<br><br>Unfortunately, I live downtown and rarely make it out of the grid so I hadn't been able to try it yet. Last Saturday I was getting my tires replaced off of Arden with my boyfriend before we headed out of town afterwhich we realized we were starving and should eat before we hit the road. Immediately I thought, ""We should go to Chandos!"" and thoughts of juicy, flavorful meats, topped with tasty sauce wrapped in warm corn tortillas popped into my head and my mouth was watering. The man had no choice. Over to Chandos we headed.<br><br>This is where the ONLY negative aspect of the place comes into play, which ultimately turns into a compliment... it just so happened that this Saturday was a gloomy, rainy, windy and terribly wet day. I was saddened to see that there was no indoor portion to the place. I know, I know, 'Taco Stand"" never implies that there would be, but my hopes were that there might be a tiny little room to stand in. Alas, there wasn't. But, (here's where the positive comes in) there was still a line! People were standing in the cold, wet rain to get some of those famous, juicy tacos! At the sight of that, there was no turning back.<br><br>I ordered the 3 taco special (with a drink only $6) so that my man could have the drink. I got two fish tacos and one chicken. He ordered the Adobado Burrito. Luckily I have an amazing boyfriend who let me go wait in the warm, dry car while they made our food. But man, it was worth every second of the wait and standing in the cold! The tacos were so juicy and tender, the produce was fresh, they didn't even need extra sauce. DOUBLE THUMBS UP! The burrito was really good too- it's basically just meat, cheese, lettuse, &amp; salsa...but even my man said it rivaled his favorite, Chipotle.<br><br>I HIGHLY recommend you give this place a try. Just don't go on a rainy day. And please, please, please Chando, don't sell out with your recent popularity. Stay try to your origins and make your food just like you do. All too often places start to try and cut costs and their food ends up taking the hit. You're rockin' it for a reason. Keep it up!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=1_cmRi6OzXKqYOxxjhXEGw

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",9/16/2010,4,"Apparently Senor Chando interpreted the 3 principle tenets of restaurant proprietorship rather loosely.  Of those 3 fundamentals (location, location, location), Chando's has none.  The tiny venue has only outdoor seating (technically, indoor seating is available if you eat in your car), offering panoramic views of the indigenous habitat and native creatures of the Del Paso area.  The restaurant is basically a nifty repurposed burger stand equipped with friendly folks, a cool rotisserie thing stacked with pork adovado (mmm...pork stack), and a simple, streamlined menu...tacos, burritos, etc.<br><br>  Lamentably, a few snags.  The tiny kitchen is unable to keep up with any level of demand, and I waited a quarter of an hour for just a couple of items.  Also, they were out of lengua...bummer.  Anyway, a taco with buche was off the hook to the highest degree, probably as good as any taco ought to aspire to be.  Quality ingredients and a richly chile-inflected sauce made the little guy sing.  A ""mulita"" turned out to be basically a mini quesadilla with meat (birria) and cilantro, messy as hell and delish for sure.<br><br>  I will definitely give Chando another holla in the near future; hopefully the kitchen operation will be a bit more streamlined but the food no less tasty.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=7bV-KmkWmnruaoH9lnQluw

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",12/17/2013,5,"While out and about in the Arden area, our rumbling tummies smelled the aroma of the meats cooking on the grill outside of Chando's.<br><br>I thought this place only served tacos but the board outside read that they also were serving tortas, tacos and these little corn quesadillas. The freindly girl at the counter also informed us that they can make us a burrito if asked.  My BF and I ordered a steak torta ($5.75) a chicken quesadilla ($2.75) and ten tacos, half adobada and half steak to split with family at home ($1.75 each) <br><br>We enjoyed the small talk of the workers who were very excited for new customers to try their food for the first time. I've noticed a pattern with business owners that take pride in their establishments; they always come through with satisfying products. I had nothing to fear at Chando's knowing their friendly demeanor spoke for the care they would take in my order.<br><br>Our large order only took ten minutes for them to cook, assemble and package up. Now THAT'S fast service! I was expecting to wait at least double the time. <br><br>As for the food, it was all delicious and quickly devoured. Packed with meat that was full of flavor with a smear of guacamole on top.  <br><br>The tortas are huge! The last time I had a torta it was smaller then the size of my hand and not flavorful at all. Chando's Tortas however, have a hard time staying together in my hands. The meat was falling out every time I took a bite. Did I mind? Heavens no! The whole thing was damn good with little after bits of meat on the plate to nibble on later.<br><br>I'm extremely happy to announce that I found a place in Sacramento that does adobada right. I usually have to drive to Williams and eat at Roberta's in order to have a satisfying adobada taco. The steak in the tacos was good as well, but it didn't stand out in flavor like the adobada meat did. <br><br>The little corn quesadilla although packed with deliciousness, was pretty dinky for the price tag of $2.75, but definitely worth a try. <br><br>The fact that Chando's is near my work doesn't help my wallet or my diet, but it sure will help and satisfy my cravings for good, flavorful tacos and tortas!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=4mzF6Qq5F0aOw_QQ7RijbQ

Chando’s Tacos,"Los Angeles, CA",2/25/2014,4,"I grew up in San Diego before I moved up north. The upside of growing up in San Diego is that the best Mexican food around is mind-blowing, and the okay Mexican food is still pretty damn good. The downside of growing up in San Diego is that it turns you into a huge Mexican food snob. Every time my friends tell me about a ""great taco shop"", I go to it and find that it's mediocre, or at least not as good as the taco shops I grew up around.<br><br>So, this week, a co-worker of mine told me about a ""great taco shop"" called Chando's. Needless to say, I was skeptical, but she's also from Southern California so I gave her a bit more credit. I drove out there after I left work Thursday night and got there around 9:15. No dice - the shop was closed and there were a few people cleaning up. Not a good start, but not enough for me to give up on it.<br><br>I was able to sneak out for a longer-than-usual lunch the next day and made my way back to Chando's. The line wasn't too long and moved along pretty quickly. I ordered 3 tacos and a drink for $6, which I think is a reasonable price but not a great bargain or anything. About 3 minutes later (which is way, way quicker than I imagined), I had three tacos in a paper tray.<br><br>You can mix and match meats, and I did just that - I got one asada, one adobada, and one lengua. I was not a huge fan of the adobada - it was tasty, but too heavily sauced and didn't have the porky flavor and textural contrasts I'm used to. The lengua was good, not awesome, but definitely good. The carne asada was spectacular, almost as good as I could get at the best places in San Diego or TJ and better than any carne asada I've had outside of Socal. It's enough to get me to come back here again.<br><br>TL;DR: I'll be back.  I'll try more meats. Hopefully, they will be more like the asada and less like the adobada, because the asada is 5-star worthy and is reason alone for me to keep Chando's as a regular in my food rotation.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=bUhjZYM0zUl7p7CtYh8iPA

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",8/10/2012,4,"The Deeda Salon of taquerias? Sorry to ruin your five-star-only honeymoon. I can think of at least half a dozen tacos I'd rather eat (Lalo's and Toledo's especially), but certainly, this place does rule the 95815 zip code for now, and they are truly a credit to this neighborhood for having caringly picked up a previously abysmal-looking burgers 'n shakes drive-in (anyone remember when this was Geneva's, Home of the Big Burger?). The place has been freshened up so painstakingly, it's like HGTV dispatched their design stars to the downtrodden Dixieanne neighborhood. The lines between the red brick and white window trim are so sharp!<br><br>The menu is minimal...mainly focusing on tacos in three meat choices for $1.75 each or 3 for $6 including a soft drink. I got spoiled during my last couple visits to L.A. when I ate so many 99th-percentile tacos al pastor for 75 cents each. $1.75 might be typical taco pricing in Sacto, but even the preponderance of eminently edible $1 and $1.25 tacos in the South area now makes me less than willing to travel all the way to North Sac. But I'm actually in this neighborhood often enough, so I figure I'll be back.<br><br>The best meat choice is the adobada, which is roasted throughout the day shawarma-style on a upright rotisserie. It's a little bit too much sweet and pineapply and not enough spicy, but it's fresh and generally pleasing.<br><br>With the tent outside on the sidewalk next to the building, it gives you the impression of the street-food style, which I like because Sacto needs very badly to get hip to street food. I wish this place luck because as far as streets go, this spot on Arden is pretty bad for visibility 'cos westbound traffic comes down that overpass really fast, and most eastbound drivers just wanna get the hell outta this neighborhood as quickly as possible.

Satisfied but still hungry decided to get a mini chorizo torta. It was very good. The place is kind of awkward to get into and there's flies everywhere but I mean we sat outside. Nothing hand waving can't fix. Not nearly the best I've had but def good enough to go back to if I'm in the area again.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=smUEig9bQ_YsFqdaTDqK5g

If it's sunny it might be nice. <br><br>My only complain is that I wish it was spicy or maybe if they offered jalapeños, which I'm not sure if they even do since I didn't ask.

Man of pork on a spit. <br><br>I ventured here today after enduring too long the mouth watering descriptions of gastronomical ecstasy that awaited me. <br><br>The authenticity greeted me in the parking lot in the form of the intoxicating aromas of pineapple-basted adobada and anchiote-citrus marinated pollo sizzling nearby.

The total came to an entirely reasonable $10. <br><br>About five minutes later I was called to the pickup window where I was presented with my order by the man himself. Chando couldn't have been a nicer guy. This is the kind of business owner you root for--someone who truly loves what he/she does and therefore, truly cares about experience, service, and QUALITY. I salute you, Chando. <br><br>The tacos themselves were out-frickin-standing. Probably the best I've had in Sacramento. Each taco is made with homemade white corn tortillas and just enough delicious sauce to enhance the meat rather than overwhelm it. The pork was tangy. juicy, and just a bit spicy--with just enough fat to contribute to the flavor without being overly greasy. The chicken was tasty and tender. Everything was FRESH.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",12/19/2011,5,"Chando's Tacos is a special place.  Not the best 'hood and it's really kind of disconcerting being THAT close to cars driving by at 45mph (the line forms a few feet from Arden and there isn't much space between the patrons in front and the cars flying past).  But the customers are not alone in the danger zone, someone is always outside taking care of all the sizzling goodness on the grill.  Last time I was there I just sat and watched as one of their taco gurus grilled the goodness with pride and skill.  You can tell Chando has instilled in his employees a passion for perfection.  This isn't Zocalos, far from it, but when a business takes pride in what they're serving it really shows in the final product.  When I eat at Chardo's it puts all the other cheap food options out there their place.  You can get three tacos here for the same price as three tacos at Taco Bell.  Really.  REALLY.  Do a side by side sometime after a couple of beers.  I can assure you that it will put Chando's into perspective for you.  This place is so good that I feel kind of bad that it's so cheap.  If they had a dinning room and it was in a better location they would be charging four times as much, and it'd be worth it.  I have had the chicken, lengua, asada, carnitas and the al pastor.  Each has been unique and magnificent in its own way.  <br><br>My one aside would be that the carnitas is so juicy, you really need to eat it outside your car.  Maybe bring a bib.  It makes a mess--a delicious, flavorful mess.  <br><br>Their avocado (and guac) is always fresh and their pico is simple and delicate, a perfect companion to their savory meats.  <br><br>Chando, you're doing it right.  I'm so happy to see a long line each time I drive by.  It's all I can do to keep driving sometimes, but alas when I cannot resist the temptation it's always a memorable experience.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ceNLxp1D39OoAGYI006N-A

Chondo's would be a huge success if it were a full restaurant.  The tacos are very, very flavorful, I ordered three, no side dishes offered... waited 50 minutes to order 3 tacos!  The taco truck ambiance is not appetizing, the continual long line ""out the door"" guaranteed everyone standing in line encroached over every table.  Someone needs to provide business direction to the owners, they are ripe for expansion!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=82hjibhh5NyEUVoUuR9jow
Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",4/9/2012,5,"I have the honor of living about 2 blocks away from Chandos' on Arden Way and I have to say how intoxicating the aroma of Fresh Carne Asada grilling on an open fire is...Mmm! From the moment I moved to this ""colorful"" neighborhood, I knew Chandos' Tacos would be a fave taqueria of mine. The burritos are the perfect portion with crisp veggies, mozzarella cheese and coming from a self proclaimed personal chef, beautifully marinated carne asada! I love queso, so if ur a queso lover u may want to ask for extra! The tacos (only tried carne asada) are perfectly assembled without cheese but yummy guac and sour cream. I actually have a horror story about a visit I took to the taqueria place nearest my house, El Forestero, so thats not happening ever again (Stomach poisoning!) I rather eat what I can watch be prepared, thank u, very much! Also, it doesnt hurt that the nice young lady at Chandos' remembers my name and recognizes me everytime! How sweet? Great addition to the neighborhood, best taco in Sac I've tasted, hands down!  Gets busy on weekends and lunch hours of the weekdays. Has parking in rear of restaurant as well as on the right and left of the establishment :) Also seems to be a fave amongst law enforcement, EMT's &amp; most recently I saw my Post woman there!

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",3/1/2015,4,"Chando is, indeed, a five stars kinda guy. But, we're rating Chando's tacos, and three and half or four stars would be more accurate.  <br><br>Pulling into Chando's parking lot, it's hard to miss the spit-grilled pork glistening in front of the taco stand. After spending a brief moment inspecting the outdoor kitchen equipment, my taste buds were ready for some mouthwatering tacos. <br><br>The Joint:<br>There are two private parking lots, one on either side of the taco stand. Normally, when I think of eating at a taco stand, dusty, splinter-inducing benches surface to mind. But, not at Chando's. Chando's has three very clean tables that each comfortably sits four people. It was one of the more pleasurable taco stand dining experiences I've had in a while. <br><br>The Food: <br>We sampled the adobada, asada, birria, &amp; fish taco. Tacos were generously filled with our choice of meats, and complemented with plenty of cilantro, onions, guacamole, and salsa. Tacos were esthetically pleasing, and the tortilla-meat-condiments ratio was near perfect. However, the al pastor was a little dry during our evening's visit.<br><br>At $1.75 per taco, and $6 for a 3-taco combo with drink, Chando's is worth checking out if you're in the area. I wouldn't recommend making a special run from out of town-- or even across town-- just for these tacos; your expectations will be too high.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=g6QqcZH6W_1sdKdQIjlhxA
Chando’s Tacos,"Carmichael, CA",11/15/2013,4,"Made the drive today from Rancho Cordova based on Yelp and Sacbee reviews. I am a taco enthusiast, and I especially like tacos that are kept simple. I was definitely happy with my tacos, I tried 4 to get a taste of the different meats. First off, the tortillas were fresh and had a nice crisp from the grill, really just right. The verde salsa on the tacos was excellent and the cilantro and onions were very fresh. Now for the meats:<br>1. Birria- essentially beef that has been prepared in a stew, the flavor was really tasted and had nice subtle hints of spice. Definitely my favorite, would give this taco 5 stars.<br>2. Asada- high quality tender steak with good flavor, probably a 4 out of 5.<br>3. Fish - tilapia, grilled, nice flavor, not the best I have ever had, 3 out of 5.<br>4. Pork Adobada - really nicely flavored, 4.5 out of 5.<br><br>Overall, will definitely be back. Staff was very friendly and prices were fair.

We liked it so much that we had them cater a work picnic of 140 people. <br>I gave a head count of 138 people 3 days ahead of time. They came out with only 2 cooks on one grill trailer. They ran out of tortillas at some point so that held things up, but the main issue is that it took 45 minutes to 1 hour 10 minutes to get food. My co-workers stood in the 92 degree heat after paying $10.00 a head for 3 tacos. It was suppose to be all you can eat tacos for 2 hours but time didn't allow for a second round. Chando even told someone ""that's the way it rolls on the taco truck!"" Some didn't get to eat at all because they weren't able to wait in line that long. <br>Because of that we weren't able to participate in 3 team building events that we had planed on our agenda. <br>In all fairness to the cooks; they worked really hard to keep up but truly needed a second grill and at least 2 more cooks.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",10/10/2011,4,"I can't believe I only learned about this place now.  Chando's has been featured many-a-time on Sac Bee in the little over a year they have been in business in Sac-Town.  It is a small little cantina as you take exit 9B for Arden Way toward I-160 from Business I-80 Freeway, it's about a mile from the exit on your right hand side.  Follow your nose to some serious BBQ grilling; your ears and feet, to blasted Tejano beats; and your heart, to some bomb Chando's Tacos up ahead!<br><br>When others have asked me where this place was, I thought it was a stationary roach coach, but this last visit around, I saw that they were in fact a true ""hole in the wall"" little establishment.  They have parking available to the right and left of the eatery and a cute outdoor patio in the back.  There is no street parking so be careful as you drive up to park because the roads are not pretty here, while on a busy 45-50 MPH speed limit road. The big YUM here is their signature Pork Adobada.  Ay, me gusta!  If you do not like spicy, watch out, but it is a flavorful pineapple marination!  Their menu is very simple: figure out what meat you want, how you want it cooked, and prepared in- taco, torta, burrito, quesadilla, mulita (whatever that one is), or tostada.  Their combo for $6 consist of 3 tacos and a Horchata drink.  Let me tell you now, that those tacos are pequeno (small), but three-bite-sized pieces of awesome!  And I just have to say it since I had co-workers ask, but Chando's does not have rice in their burrito or anywhere, and does not make crunchy tacos.  Also torta is another way of saying it's a Mexican sandwich.  In my culture, and I found out Mexicans also serve this for breakfast, TORTA is fried eggs and ground beef patties so that's what I expected.  Meh-meh, wrong!  I didn't like torta personally, but the good thing was that I was so full afterwards, but I recommend the Pork Adobada burrito, Birria taco, or Fish Taco.  <br><br>Get your fill for Mexi-grub at Chando's- no need to cross any border to haggle with la Migra or bargain with crazy cab drivers to get there because this one's just miles down the street from the Arden Mall!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=DJtjkCR8R8G4H3Ir8YIXGQ

Chando’s Tacos,"Camino, CA",3/26/2012,2,"THEY SHOULD CALL THIS PLACE ""ONION CITY"", OR MAYBE ""ONION OUTLET""<br><br>I'm not sure what the hype is all about with this place, but I found their food pretty bland and dry. Perhaps the most irritating factor, though, is that pretty much everything they sell is HEAVILY laced with raw onions. Sure, sure, onions are a part of the mexican food experience, I get that, but there are some in the general public who simply cannot eat raw onions. These guys make NO provision for removing raw onions from their food. I recently decided to give them another try. I ordered a cheese quesadilla, and explicitly stated ""NO ONIONS OF ANY KIND"" on the quesadilla. I thought there was no possible way they could screw that up, but.....I get the quesadilla back to work, and on the first godforsaken bite, my mouth filled with the vile taste of putrid, raw onion. I embarrassingly spit the mouthfull of food out in revulsion in front of my coworkers, and ran for the bathroom. They refunded my money and explained that they have a cross-contamination problem when they reach from one bin to another when assembling the food, so onions get into the cheese.

Chando’s Tacos,"Galt, CA",7/26/2014,5,"Finally I have found an amazing taco in Sacramento! Which I always find funny because there is a large Hispanic community out here and yet after 10 years it's still hard to find good Mexican food that compares to what I grew up with in San Jose. <br><br>Back to Chandos...I lucked out, went a little after 1pm on a Wednesday and there was very short line. We ended up waiting about 10 min before ordering which was fine by me so I could figure out what I was going to order. Ended up getting the taco combo, 3 tacos and a drink for $6, not bad! By boyfriend got the same so we were able to try the adobada, carne asada, carnitas, and the chicken. I wasn't a huge fan of the adobada, that's pork that they cook on a rotisserie with pineapple. It had just a touch of sweetness and a good smokey chili flavor. It was my boyfriends favorite, mine was the carne asada. Not over done at all! Perfectly cooked and seasoned, just what I would have expected. The chicken was nice and moist, not dry like some have said. I could see the chicken getting dry if it was busy or something though, it's hard taking chicken off of the grill at the perfect time. Oh and the carnitas were good too! All of the tacos were topped with fresh cilantro and onion with a wedge of lime on corn tortillas. Your typical street taco, a REAL taco. <br><br>If you like a more Americanized taco, you know with cheese, and lots of veggies, sour cream, etc. You won't be getting that here at Chandos. They do their tacos pretty authentic. <br><br>One last thing: don't forget where you're at. Everyone can say funny things about the area, but hey we all know it's not the nicest of neighborhoods.

They've gained notoriety in the area through both their food trucks and brick-and-mortar locations. This particular location might not be in the most...um...""scenic"" part of Sac but man is it worth the trip!  The tacos de papa (potato tacos) are divine! It consisted of perfectly mashed potatoes topped with cheese and hot sauce. They also do a wonderful job with the mulitas, (a corn tortilla quesadilla). Be warned that the flattop will add WAYYYY too much salt to the outside of the tortillas but that can be easily remedied with some napkin theatrics. Once de-salinated however, the mulitas are superb. Included in these ""little mules"" is guacamole and your choice of meat or veg (any choice is a good one). The cheese is allowed to flow out of the tortillas and onto the grille where it evolves into a crunchy, orange slice of culinary heaven. 5 stars is not enough!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BgOazGvd2stZHK84mqrWOg

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",12/11/2010,4,"First let me tell you that I've been a pretty big fan of Island Taco's for quite awhile now, when I want a few nice street taco's. Well, there is a new favorite in town and I found myself repeating the word ""amazing"" bite after bite. I read about this place on Yelp and will have to admit, I've probably driven past this place umpteenth million times and have never even know it was there (yes, blink and you'll miss it). After reading the reviews, I had to see if Chando's really lived up to the out of control hype it had received. Not too often do you find a taco stand on Yelp with a 4.5 star rating out of 86 reviews with nothing less than 3 stars. Was this for real?<br><br>Well, it lived up to the hype AND some. Me and the fiance headed down there on a Friday night for some take-out (I normally dont write reviews for take-out because it's not fair to the place since after a 10 min drive home it's typically not as fresh as it normally would be). We pulled up to a tiny little taco stand illuminated with hanging lights on the shiny silver trailer grill loaded with the various meats that were sending ridiculous aroma's down Arden Way. There was a staff of 3 inside the actual stand, one making fresh Pico de gallo from fresh ingredients right in the front window. This was automatically a plus for me, no fake crap and brilliantly done if you think about it. Make it known to your customers that you use only the freshest ingredients by simply making it in the window and not in the back. Well done. The gal taking our order was very friendly and helpful, making recommendations for us noobie's.<br><br>I had the 3 taco combo ($6 bucks) that included a soda. I chose 1 Asada and 2 Adobada taco's with an Asada Mulita on the side. These were 3 of the best street taco's I've ever consumed in my 32 years. The flavor's were off the charts,size was perfect (not too big, not too small). The mulita was a little on the greasy side for me, but again, definitely had great flavor and I would probably order it again.<br><br>So whatever Chando is doing, he needs to keep doing it because he is doing it right. My new favorite taco stand in Sac and I even bought a t-shirt to help spread the word.<br><br>Do yourself a favor, go throw a few of Chando's taco's into your belly, you wont regret it.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=pe8uBaOaNVc4GhHkf11r8Q

We asked how it would be quicker and so the guy said call it in before you come so one day we did and same thing 45min and 3 families later we get our food but its only when I go with someone else and its not like we order 1 of everything just like 4-6 tacos in total. But what really grinds my gears is that ive witnessed if a Caucasian customer complains they get something extra if a Hispanic customer complains they get nothing..

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",5/3/2012,5,"TL; DR Amazing. Eat here.<br><br>(So it took me a *little* longer to get out here than originally promised... See my Chando's Taco Truck review.)<br><br>Holy mother of $deity!<br><br>Chando's has finally convinced me that there is amazing Mexican food in California. Before you write off the rest of this review, just understand that I am a Texan. Mexican food and *honest* Tex-Mex (steak fajitas done proper are my favorite food) are simply different than the Mexican cuisine found here. Californians worship the taco, and until I found Chando's, I never quite understood why. (Actually, I did become addicted to fish tacos, via Pescados [RIP].)<br><br>11 years later, I understand. Chando's Taco Truck began my enlightenment at  SactoMoFo 4. I didn't have a taco. I had - instead - an unknown delicacy known as a mulita.<br><br>Today, I had another Mulita de Adobada, because that original experience was so transformational. And... This was better. It was everything mentioned in my taco truck review, except this thing was *loaded*. The cheese and meat were so plentiful that they had spilled out and kissed the grill, making the edges crunchy in a very delicious way. The inside was delicious and had just the perfect dab of guacamole. Perfection.<br><br>I also had two tacos, a lengua and fish. The lengua was amazingly flavorful, stewed to perfection. It was like eating a brisket taco, if the brisket wasn't stringy. Awesome. Next time, I'll probably ask for extra cilantro, because I'm a sucker for it. Still, the meat was perfect, and I'm fine with it being the focus of that particular taco.<br><br>The fish taco deserves its own couple of paragraphs. This was a very, very different creature than my initial fish taco love that Pescado's [RIP] introduced me to many, many moons ago. Pescado's used lightly battered fish (I think it was cod), cabbage, and a crema-based sauce that probably contained chipotle.<br><br>Chando's version of this was smaller, with lovingly homemade white corn tortillas, and almost completely different. The fish was grilled in a red sauce - I'm almost certain it was the adobada - and I'm given to believe that it was tilapia, as others have stated. The only common denominator, cabbage, was next, then a light drizzle of another crema-based sauce. Now, in eating this thing, I can say the big difference is: I knew I was eating fish. From my previous experiences, I just knew that I was eating fried fish. The sauce that Chando's marinates their fish in totally removes the need to do anything as barbaric as frying. From somewhere, there was a beautiful heat - not too intense, mind you - but beyond that, there was a crunch from cabbage, and just lovely fish. If you don't like fish, you will hate these. More for me.<br><br>So, I am fully intending to eat my way through the menu. The whole thing. Further reviews will be solely focused on reviewing meats. (Fortunately, there are only two that are unfamiliar to me.) I might eventually convince myself to try a burrito, but don't hold your breath. The mulitas and tacos are simply too good.<br><br>(Also, I was recognized by one of the taco truck guys - they were headed out to Elk Grove for a mini-SactoMoFo! He hooked me up with a Chando's Tacos shirt. These are quite honestly some of the coolest guys slinging tacos, ever.)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=rCTLtETUCbCfhdgVx_bGrg

Fast forward to lunch time and bam, I was not impressed to say the least. I ordered the combo meal, 3 tacos and a drink. The price was decent, $6.00, and that's where it goes downhill from there. Out came my horchata first and boy was it sweeter than the sugar it was made from! A little too sweet if you ask me. I ordered the carne asada and it looked appetizing. I quickly dug in and was taken aback at how spicy the green sauce was. It totally took away the taste of the carne asada. I squeezed some lime on it to put out the fire and I think it worked. The carne asada was really overcooked in my opinion and there was a real salty taste to it. My co-worker had a burrito and I noticed it was like really small, almost half the size of some other regular burritos from other taquerias!

Our order took about 15 minutes to be made, but there was about 4 orders in front of us and everything is freshly made. During waiting, we watched a guy cooking more meat right outside and it made it hard to wait while smelling the food. <br>We finally got our food, found a seat, and dug in. I was let down because I has ordered no onions and no guacamole and both of my things had them on it, but the line was even longer then when we got there and it was almost closing time, so I decided to just pick them off. I can say that I think if I had went up, they would have made them again with no problems. Even though my food was made wrong, it was damn yummy!!!<br>It was juicy, messy in a good way and tasty. <br>Will be going back soon!!!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=T9ELbKVquSboabeRBPSTwQ

I was not impressed. <br> <br>Location: The hood is ok to venture to but it is a order at the window and sit in the paved backyard. Parking is not worth trying in the dinky parking lot so you have to parking in the neighborhood.<br>Menu: you have the bare basic of items to order. Price is hardly adequate but it squeezes by. They offer Chips &amp; Pico for $1 but the chips seemed like they were out of a Tostitos bag &amp; Pico is not my thing.  I was looking for some good salsa but there was none to be offered. The good is they offered Coke products but the lines are so long no chance of getting a refill.<br>Food: It was sub par - nothing that dazzled the pallet. I got a chicken taco &amp; carne asada taco which were the basic street tacos style.  The chicken had a good bar-b-que flavor and were topped with the cilantro, onion, green salsa &amp; faux-guacamole. The asadas was not happening due to the fat grizzle that was in almost every bite. It was so bad at one point I had to spit out the fat chunk after wrestling on chewing it down for about 2 minutes. Others got a Mulita which resembled a corn tortilla quesadilla for $2.50  and then someone else got a Torta for $5.50.  That would have been the best deal if you like a sandwich with taco fillings which is not my deal. <br> <br> <br>In conclusion I feel they work well for their food truck scenario but I would not care to make the trek back unless someone else was driving and buying;) Taqueria Giralbaldi wins by far with the chips &amp; salsa bar alone.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=e954Am4oCiU6uY45gO1ySQ

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",5/6/2011,3,"So yesterday was Cinco De Mayo and we wanted some mexican food for lunch. We've been hearing about this place for a couple months now so we thought we'd see what the fuss was all about. <br><br>As others have mentioned, there's a descent line...it's not in the best area of town(if you're worried about that)...limited parking, etc. So we park around the corner in the residential neighborhood and walk up. Waited 10 min in line or so. Waited another 10-15 min for the food. Between the two of us we had a Torta (Adobada), two Mulitas (Asada and Carnitas) and some Chips/Pico. <br><br>I must admit there was not one point while i was eating where I thought ""oh man this is so good"". With all the rave reviews I would have expected to say that at least once. That never happened. I've certainly had better tortas (i don't even think there was cheese on it) and the mulitas were nowhere near as good as others have mentioned. Not bad, but not spectacular in any way, shape or form. The Adobada was good i suppose. Not sure how you'd give this place 5 stars though. I've gone out of the way for some tacos plenty of times before, but I certainly wouldn't do so for this place.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=Z0qurjfxoCnOjPK7IZttaQ

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",10/30/2010,5,A co-worker suggested this place. A little background on my co-worker.. He is a chef as a side job and is a food junky. Loves to try out dives (whole in the wall) type of places. He is always honest with his suggestions and definitely can be somewhat picky. <br>So I decided to go with his judgment and give Chando's a try during my lunch break on a Tuesday. I head down Garden Highway and soon realize this is the little hut that previously was a hamburger spot. I remember driving by and always seeing LONG lines down the sidewalk with business men stopping by during their lunch hour. Not too sure what happened to the place. So I pull into a parking spot. At first I thought their biggest problem would be parking until I hopped out of my car to get in line and realized there is parking on both sides of this hut. The lady at the register I would soon realize is the owners wife. Very young and friendly. I order my food for myself and a few coworkers then proceed to ask her about catering options. She tells me to call her husband and he is open to any ideas for catering. I work for a department that orders foot weekly for meetings so I am always keeping my eyes and ears open to new places to order food from. After ordering I realize they are cooking fresh carne asada outside. Mmmmm smelt sooo yummy! So I head back to the office and pass out everyones orders. Everyone got the 3 tacos and a soda for $6.00 special. I began eating my food and fell in LOVE! The meat in the tacos had so much flavoring. The only down fall was the strong odor from the salsa. It was a strong onion smell. Tasted delicious but in an office the smell can be strong! Love this place and will be going back again soon!,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=sMnTVa1g2pYtJWuaX2gICQ

Chando’s Tacos,"Rocklin, CA",4/15/2013,5,"Best street taco's I've had in the US.<br><br>The other stuff is great too, but I can't literally call it the best I've had in the US.  Only street taco I ever had that tasted better than Chando's was literally a shack somewhere off the highway down in Mexico south of Tijuana towards Rosarito and Ensenada.  Best fish tacos I ever had, even if it was cooked in an old oil drum and had flies everywhere.  Since this isn't Mexico, this is some high praise.  Sacramento isn't known for its cuisine, but I'm from LA and Chando's would be considered among the best Mexican food even in LA.  For sure it blows away anything in San Francisco.  Easily.  Tried those high rated places in SF.  Ok, but compared to Chando's, they only rate about a 3 star before you even consider the parking.  With parking, I'd rate them 1 star and tell you to just go to Del Taco's drive thru.<br><br>Chando's has recently upgraded.  Chando finally fixed up the area in the back, so there's a lot more outdoor seating and actually has a decent sized gravel lot to park in.  You can still park in those two tiny lots on either side of the restaurant, but one of the openings to the gravel lot is in the right one now.<br><br>The menu has expanded along with the hours.  Open late every day now.  Yeah!  I drive from the Roseville area all the way down to Chando's so it's nice to not have to rush to make it by 8pm or something.<br><br>I typically get the Chando's Combo.  3 tacos and a drink.  My typical order is Asada, Birria, and Adobada with a Horchata to drink (cost a bit more than if you order soda).  Once in a while, I'll mix it up with a fish taco.  I just went tonight and noticed the expanded menu.  Was gonna try the Chorizo but they were out.  Fish is good as well.  Chicken's not bad as is the Carnitas, but those two are prolly my least favorite cuz they only rate average IMO.  Since everything else is soooooo good, I feel like it's not ""worth"" it to order ""just"" the chicken or carnitas.  Don't be afraid to try the other stuff.  Sure, lingua is tongue and sounds gross, but it's actually REALLY good.  I mean, it's not like escargot where the actual taste isn't gross if you don't think about what you're eating.  Escargot doesn't really taste like anything except butter cuz it's drowned in it.  The lingua actually has a ton of flavor and is chewy like meat.  Just imagine it's rib or something.<br><br>The burrito is good too, but then you fill yourself up with only one choice of meat.  I like the smaller items like the tacos or tostada (small like the taco, but on a crispy air filled shell) so I can order different types of meat.<br><br>They have an actual drink selection too.  It's not just soda.  I think they have beer (don't hold me on that), and different Mexican sodas.  Horchata and some other drink, but the horchata is just the fountain drink kind you get anywhere.  Still hits the spot tho when combined with some of the spicy stuff.<br><br>No, it's not fancy, but the taste is right up there with any fancy restaurant.  It's sort of like gourmet Mexican food cuz the flavor is just so much better and sophisticated than a ""regular"" Mexican joint.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=BN0A--UWIGBvSGKdY0Q64Q

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",10/27/2011,2,"I'm pretty angered by the extremely high rating for this place. I read a review on this place in the SN&amp;R best of edition and, coupled with the high rating on yelp I decided to try them out after class. The line was really long when I got there, really long. Under any other circumstance I would have went somewhere else but I HAD to try this stuff. I waited 15 minuets just to order. I ordered a chorizo taco and put Chando to the Carne Asada test (I ordered a Carne Asada burrito). I use this test when I try out any Mexican resturaunt. Carne Asada  is hard for resturaunts to do right for some reason. Freshness and simplicity are the keys to good Asada. Chando failed. The taco was good, the chorizo was cooked fresh and they put guacamole on it. But then again street tacos are hard to screw up, just cook the tortilla, grill the meat and put some onion and cilantro on it. Bam! It's that easy! When the kid who handed me my bag gave me my food I thought the he had the wrong food because I was expecting it (the bag) to weigh much more (authentic burritos usually include a plethera of ingridients). Turns out I was wrong. The burrito was small, possibly the smallest burrito I've gotten from a mexican place. The asada was like reconstituted Jack Links Jerky. Also, the tomatos were soggy in the burrito. I was highly dissapointed, first at Chando, then all of you yelpers, then myself. I' am rapidly losing faith in this website. Whenever there is a fantastic rating its usually too good to be true.

I have honestly had everything on the menu (except breakfast) and each meat has its own awesomeness to it. But asada just has a special place in my heart so I always go back to her.

Chando’s Tacos,"Carmichael, CA",9/7/2011,3,My brother loves this place and had been talking about it for awhile so I finally went with him for lunch.  The food was ok but I was not blown away by the quality of their food.  The place was busy and the seating was outside.  Their pork is what my brother loves and I got a taco with pork and it was not too bad.  The pork tasted similar to cinnamon.  The taco was good but not what I want in a taco.  I would return however I would not go out of my way to get their food.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=dzqltUqwz4z4A35cJ9aPPA

I was just talking to my husband about how I wished there was a taqueria like the ones at the border and all of a sudden my wish came true. I was googling and Chando's Tacos came up. After looking at the pictures I HAD to taste. Needless to say they didnt disappoint at all. The owner was very friendly and took some of his time to talk to us about how he started his business. He was very  passionate about his product and took much pride in it. That always speaks well of the quality. Anyways stop by if you are around.

The marinade and salsa that they used were amazing.  The spice level was just right as well. I noticed they had some unusual cuts on the menu like buche and lengua, might try those next time. The service was also great, especially for what is basically a road side stand. We went on a busy friday night, and even though there were almost 20 people ahead of us in line, we still got our food within 5 minutes.

It's impossible to diet so instead I vow never to waste calories on horrible food. I can do some damage here. The meat is so flavorful. It's marinated and grilled to perfection. We had the lengua, adobada, tilapia and carne asada tacos. We also ordered a carne asada burrito and carne asada mulitos. We loved everything but only liked the burrito. I'm not used to a burrito with lettuce in it and with no beans or rice. The mulito was so good. It reminded me of a children's sized quesadilla. I loved the gooey cheese paired with the perfect carne asada. Did I mention the green sauce that brought it all together? The tacos were a great way to sample all the meat. They were smaller than the normal ones found at similar places but its okay because it tastes so damn good. The chicken was spicy and I love spicy food. The lengua was very very tender. The fish taco is a must and oh so good. It was my husband's favorite. The adobada was good also but it would be my least favorite if I had to choose one. I'm def going to come back over and over again. I'll have to walk around the mall to burn the calories off.

Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",10/25/2011,3,"Let me start off by saying that Chando's is a legit taco stand for Sacramento.  I was incredibly excited to try out what many claimed to finally be the area's quintessential taco stand.  However, as a few of the other reviewers have pointed out, and I have to agree: it's decent, but BADLY OVER-HYPED.  I also tried every meat they serve, just to be sure I wasn't missing anything.  I'm sorry to say I was not missing much.<br><br>First, let's lay down the pluses:<br>- Fast, friendly service<br>- Authentic, fresh ingredients<br>- Good value (lots of meat in each taco!)<br><br>What could be so wrong to warrant only a 3-star rating, then?  Let me tell you:<br>- I asked Chando what was better: the carne asada or the carnitas (since I love both and consider them definitive when it comes to taquerias).  He dodged the question, so I ordered both along with lengua.  Verdict: Lengua lovingly tender, but sadly underseasoned; Carne Asada good not great; and oh, the Carnitas...HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT.  Nothing at all like the beautiful, slightly crisp, incredibly juicy pork bonanza it's supposed to be.<br>- In an attempt to rectify the let-down-de-puerco, I followed up with Chando's rec of Adobada, which was the second best taco I had (not saying much), and the mildest Pastor I can safely say I've ever had (any pastor fanatic will be just as disappointed as I was by the carnitas).  Not a single pork taco totally amazed me.  In resignation, I followed with one of each of the rest of the meats.  Bottom line: with the exception of the carnitas, all the meats were prepared extremely well, but under-seasoned.<br>- I totally get it, especially with the recent influx of yuppie patrons after the rave reviews, but I fo sho got the gringo treatment.  Bro, even if I did not grow up border-hopping in SD platicaba con la raza, I think I'd know my way around a taqueria menu without having it explained to me.  Other visitors unfamiliar with Mexican food might find it helpful, but I found it condescending and a tad prejudiced.<br><br>Most people will probably find less fault with my last point than with the first two.  Granted, this review is obviously colored by Chando's recent hype and my personal high expectations of Mexican food, but I feel confident that even people who did not grow up with moms, friend's moms, aunties, abuelitas and their comadres stuffing them with homemade Mexican wonders will agree with my rating (especially if you love carnitas or carne asada!).<br><br>Get the birria tacos, even though they're made with beef instead of goat.  They're the best thing there, and  the only thing that made the trip worth it, earning the three star rating in spite of everything else.<br><br>IMHO, Woodland still has the best Mexican food in the area...but I'm still hoping for something ""closer to home,"" closer to my new home in Sac =)",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WaPF3BdGgtOhLFP-qWGoYA

Chando’s Tacos,"Antelope, CA",2/7/2011,3,"I wanted to see what the fuss was all about so I went and tried their adobada, chicken, and buche tacos; I also had a steak mulita. Let's start with the adobada. The flavor and taste was below average, compared to any other taqueria in town. I was disappointed because I am a big fan of adobada and al pastor. The chicken was suprisingly delicious. The chicken tore apart easily and had a good flavor, not to mention it had that distinct char grill flavor to it, love it. This was the first time I had ever tasted buche and it was great. The buche had a crispy yet soft texture to it. The outside skin was cooked to a crisp and the inner part of the meat was tender and sabroso. The steak wasn't anything special. The asada was the same as any other carniceria that sells their asada pre marinated. It wasn't overcooked and was tender. It would have been better if they would have thrown some salsa roja on the adobada and carne asada, instead of the salsa de aguacate. That salsa is good on the chicken but not on everything. Perhaps I expected too much from this place after reading all the reviews. Don't get me wrong, it was good but don't expect me to go out of my way to get these tacos.

The carnitas were so bland, i am utterly disappointed. If this is all it takes to get a 4.5 star rating then i need to open a taco truck, you would be blown away by my carnitas. At nearly $3 a taco they should be some darn good HUGE tacos, they are not. They are tiny street tacos and lack taste. Oh and the two rat traps sitting outside the entry to the kitchen? Not exactly appetizing. You'd think they'd at least pick them up during the day, wouldn't you if you owned a business? Parking is horrible too, and don't get shot walking back to your car. My suggestion is to stay far far away from this place and give El Parian on Watt a try they have $1 carnitas tacos on Thursdays that are amazing, or Betos on El Camino.

Granted, the tacos are pretty small, but they're pretty packed with chicken and other ingredients. But wow, after that first bite, I could taste the different flavors in the chicken. This place makes amazing tacos. The atmosphere is also pretty authentic, there was some salsa dancing music playing (but it wasn't so loud that you couldn't talk to people), and there were some Christmas lights hanging (like all year around), and there was open seating outside, behind the restaurant, under part of the building so there was a nice breeze passing through. I only wish the salsa was the blended kind (instead of the chopped onions and chopped tomato type of salsa), and I think the chips were the store bought kind (because they were really thick and bland).

Chando’s Tacos,"Ladera Ranch, CA",6/5/2011,5,"O M G! (Haha), the tacos here are SO good!!! After hearing about this place here on Yelp and seeing people praise it, and waiting a long time to finally go, I was not disappointed! I went around 3:30pm during the week one day with my parents and there was no line at all. I ordered the 3 tacos &amp; a large drink special for $6 (which is a pretty good deal). I tried the adobada pork, chicken, and carne asada tacos. The adobada pork was good, I enjoyed the taste of the pork, and the carne asada was good too, but my favorite hands down was the chicken taco I ate. Not only are the tacos super yummy,but they have the best Horchata I've ever had! (I've had it A LOT in my life time). I was definitely impressed with the quality of the food, the freshness, and the place is super cute too! It looks like a typical taco stand but it is SUPER clean. I was surprised by how clean even the patio was (it's outdoors, things outside tend to get dirty easily). My parents and I sat in a nice quiet little spot, enjoyed our delicious tacos while salsa music was coming out of the speakers. Another thing that got me to love the place more :) You don't really hear salsa music at Mexican restaurants (it's always Mariachi), and the salsa was good salsa. Oh, added bonus, I noticed the owner walk in (recognized him from pictures on their website), and he was a really nice guy. He walked over to our table and chatted for a minute. I personally gave him my review and I said I would definitely return for some more tacos :))))",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=AGObmV66Wi_gq8Ep3XNuFQ
Chando’s Tacos,"Sacramento, CA",7/16/2010,5,"Well, I always see this place on my way to work so I decided to stop by for lunch one day and got some al pastor tacos. Wow! Some of the best al Pastor tacos I have ever had outside of Mexico. My fiance had been craving some fish tacos so I convinced her to go the following week for lunch, and the fish tacos were so good she made me take her back for dinner so she could get more. Seriously, the best fish tacos I have ever had in the US. I have since tried the other meats on the menu. The carne asada is good, not as good as the pastor or the fish, but good. The chicken is really flavorful and it had a really nice charred flavor to it. And the birria is also really good and tender, although it's beef and not goat like birria usually is. Overall, this place is good enough so that if you plopped it down in Southern California, it would still be a great place, and that is high praise coming from me.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=0jxjl1g5rBi6Lua0J2ceLQ

The mac and cheese balls are a must try if you can get an order in before they run out. <br><br>I would recommend staying away from the hotdog. There is nothing negative about it.

It used to be a large grilled cheese sandwich with Mac and cheese and pulled pork. Today, I could barely make out a few noodles and the meet only covered a small side of the sandwich.

The thing I liked most about it, was they didn't take themselves too seriously or try too hard. One thing I've noticed with food trucks the past couple years is that a lot of them have tried to turn themselves into a trendy, daring experience... instead of just being food. Drewski's doesn't do that.<br><br>Their Korean short rib taco was delicious. They had special sauce along bbq sauce on the taco with succulent meat that was delicious. It was a simple street taco, but gave you a mouthful of excellent flavor. Their fries were nothing to write home about, but the seasoning was solid and hey...

I was not particularly in the mood for grilled cheese and decided to purchase a side off fried mac and cheese and bacon balls. <br>I was not impressed with the selection. The mac and cheese balls were covered in a sauce that took away from the mac and cheese. The bacon also seemed too be non-existent. They were also a bit doughy.

I got my order and man I was disappointed. So the sandwich is cut in half. I looked in one half of the sandwich to find it was mostly bread. This is definitely not a true French dip sandwich. I showed the server and he said he would check on it. I don't know what he was checking on. The proof was in the sandwich. The server came back a short time later saying the meat is portioned out. That is great if it's portioned out. Still doesn't explain why almost half of my half sandwich was all bread???  I did buy a French dip which normally contained roast beef and cheese. I did not buy a French bread dip sandwich. I could have went to Panera and bought a piece of bread and dipped into beef sauce. <br><br>The tater tots had a strong garlic presence. They were fine but I couldn't eat them all. <br><br>In short the sandwich was just ok and definitely lacking in the meat department. If you don't believe me, take a look at my pictures. <br><br>Would I go back, probably not. For what I paid, I could get a better sandwich at Togo's. Sorry Drewski's but you fell short.

I attended the Downtown Sac Event on the last night of the festivities with some family and friends that had never had Drewski's before. I was literally jacked to see they were at the park when we arrived. I went straight to the truck to order food for the whole crew. When I got to the truck the line was massive! I get it, it was hot, busy, and constant. I got to the window the cashier stared at me. No ""Hi"", ""How can I help you"", ""Can I take your order""... Nothing. Dude was a dry as a rock. I ordered 60 dollars worth of food, SIXTY! I never do that. After I ordered, there was no ""Thank You""... again Nothing! The next customer behind me, gets a ""Hey bud hows it going"" I don't like to pull the race card but come on serious.<br><br>After waiting a good twenty minutes the food was ready and needless to say my issues subsided. The Totchos, Hemi, and Smoreski were all on point as expected! My crew and I stayed at the park till the end of the night. I'd say about 10 minutes before closing I went back to order another round of Smoreskis because everyone thought they were AMAZING! I go to the truck... another blank stare. As if I did something to offend the same guy at the cashier window. My blood is warming at this point. Then some cook on the side of the truck hears that I had ordered three Smoreskis and says ""Hell No"" under his breath. Shaking his head and telling the cashier that ""we are all out, I don't want to make any."" The cashier apologized and said ""He's upset, because those are the hardest things to make on the truck.""<br><br>How is that my fault? On top of the money I spent previously, here I am back to order more food ($22) and I get this BS! I had my family with me so I didn't cause a scene. I ordered the food and waited.

I happened to glance over at the pick up window and what do you know, three Smoreski's sitting out. I walked over to grab them and this time all three guys in the truck stared me down.

My work has me constantly traveling through out California and the ONE TIME I get the chance to have the food again this crap happens.<br><br>You just lost a loyal fan, customer, and marketer.

I always rave about this food truck. Anybody I come across and wants to know about food trucks I always speak highly of these guys.. today I was at the exhibit for  four hours. I thought I'd take a break and go out to their food truck to grab some lunch. I know that it's not on the menu but I just happened to ask the guy that was taking my order if they could do a Prius. He turned  to the cook and asked him if he wanted to make one. The look on the cook's face was very upsetting and I felt unwelcome... after I saw the look on his face I just told him 'you know what never mind I'll take whatever you have on the menu'. If it wasn't for them being the only truck that I'm familiar with at the event I wouldn't of  purchased anything.

This does entice you to check and explore their menu. I finally had a hand on my Mustang and it is a serious piece of sandwich. The Korean braised beef is a mouthful of tender and succulent goodness. The rest of the cast in this sandwich is solid, but I do see the Siracha-Wasabi Aioli running short. I did not feel any spice or kick in the sandwich, which is almost a norm in Korean dish. The Mac N Cheese was also alright. It felt like I can whip a mac n cheese of this magnitude and just deep fry it at home.

The mac and cheese lacked flavor. <br><br>I also got an order of tater tots tossed in garlic and rosemary. The tots had a nice crisp but the rosemary was overpowering.

But as I kept ordering them over the past few months, they almost completely stopped putting rosemary and garlic on their tots. I have to ask for extra on my tots now just to get some on there. They are three dollars for a side order, I feel like I shouldn't have to ask...especially when the tots are known for that! <br><br>Also, as they have become more popular, they cannot handle the crowd. I always have to double check my order because it's almost always wrong or they forgot something (like an order of tots).

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Folsom, CA",7/12/2013,4,"I don't care what you are doing, if you see this truck parked somewhere-STOP and grab some of this deliciousness. <br><br>This truck was parked outside of my office last week, and I was like "" Yeah-so what?""About 5 minutes later, the smell of garlic traveled over to my cube and smacked me upside the head. At that point I had to get up to locate (and possible try a bite of ) what  smelled so good. I stared uncomfortably at my coworkers Korean beef sandwich (Mustang) and tater tots smothered in garlic and rosemary. He assured me that it was as delicious as it looked and asked me to get out his face because he was trying to eat.<br><br>SOLD! <br><br>I immediately sent my wife a text that read something like this:<br><br>MY OFFICE/KOREAN BEEF / GARLIC TOTS/ BRING CASH /HURRY <br><br>Two and a half minutes later , my wife and son came by to join me for lunch. The sandwich itself was layered with flavor and big enough for us to share. The beef was tender, and the spicy aoli spread was a nice touch. <br><br>*** SIDE NOTE** <br><br>We ordered ours without kimchi and daikon as we didn't want to take away from the flavor of the beef, cheese, and perfectly grilled bread.<br><br>As far as the tots are concerned- WOW! These crispy delights are tossed up in a bowl with garlic bits and rosemary. Not a good combo when you have to go back to work and actually talk to people. Man -that garlic stayed with me for the rest of the day.  <br><br>The sandwich and tots set me back  $ 10.50 not including tip. Sure, it was a little pricey-but well worth it.<br><br>Why not 5 stars? For one thing, I didn't exactly feel the customer service was that great. The gentleman who took my order was nice, but the other guys on the truck were not friendly at all. I also found the menu to be somewhat  limited with only 4 sandwich options to choose from.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Concord, CA",2/14/2017,5,"So bomb. Addicted to the HEMI (grilled cheese w/ pulled pork, mac &amp; cheese and caramelized onions.) But EVERYTHING is good here. Best food truck in Sacramento. I live in Concord so I'm always sure to hunt them down anytime they come to 'off the grid' out this way.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",4/23/2011,3,"When I first heard that there was going to be a grilled cheese truck, I was excited! When I saw their menu online, I was even more excited- deep fried mac 'n' cheese balls and crème brulee! I didn't want to drive out of my way to track them down though, so I patiently waited for them to be in a nearby area.<br><br>Today was that day. What I didn't know was that they were also catering to a private party at the park. Even though technically there was no line when I got there, they had a bunch of orders that needed to be made for the private party. I overheard two other people complaining to each other that they should have stated they were catering to a private party, and notify twitter followers a different time for them to come. I had to wait a while until my order was taken. When I asked them how long my food was going to take, I was told 10 minutes. That was not the case. First my sandwich came out. When I finished my sandwich, my crème brulee came out. When I finished my crème brulee, my mac 'n' cheese came out.<br><br>-The Mustang: $7.50. Braised Korean boneless beef short rib, house-made Kimchi, crispy daikon strings, melted havarti cheese and Saracha / wasabi aoli grilled on brioche bread (Copied and pasted from their website.)<br>This was a filling sandwich. My friend liked it a lot but I thought it was too salty. It had a lot of meat, so it overshadowed the other ingredients.<br><br>-Crème Brulee: $4. It was really creamy- almost like pudding.<br><br>-Deep fried mac 'n' cheese balls: $4 for 4. The first thing I noticed was that they were swimming in a small puddle of oil. Eek! They were good (crispy outside and gooey inside) but if you wanted mac and cheese that is formed into a shape- try the ones at Lounge ON20 instead. <br><br>Something I think they should have done was keep better track of whose food was whose, for example take down customers names. They just shouted what they finished making and some people who stood in line after others got their food before others. I also found it a bit off-putting that one of the chefs didn't seem to know their own menu. He called out an order of the pork sandwich. A lady asked him if that was The Hemi. He said he didn't know the name but it is the one with the pork. How hard is it to learn your own menu? <br><br>Overall, I'm glad to check this truck off of my list of places I need to eat at. I do not feel the need to track it again, but if I happen to spot it I wouldn't mind trying their other food items.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=ep8NBpLx5cfwy2CaE7cG4A

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",,4,Drewski's is one of the better food trucks in the Sacramento area.  Their sandwiches are essentially grilled cheese sandwiches with a lot more ingredients.  Drewski's has two very addicting sandwiches: the Hemi (pulled pork) and the Mustang (Korean braised beef).  The only negative about the truck is that a sandwich and tots combo is $11 ($8 for the sandwich and $3 for the tots) and that doesn't include a drink.  I still buy from them every chance I get because their food is very tasty and apparently to me the food is worth the cost.  I highly recommend Drewski's.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YvdbjmcQny7lCG64LBSyIg

Coated in garlic-y goodness like a potent hug, these tots did not last too long on the table. I am definitely a fan of garlic but even my limits were tested- the garlic while deliciously delicious was a bit overloaded with the garlic. My husband was a fan and had more than his half of the tots, preferring the loads of garlic heaped upon the tots. Maybe a smidgen bit less next time? Or I'll just offer my garlic excess to my garlic devotee of a husband. <br><br>The tricycle was a nice twist on a grilled cheese. I'm allergic to certain honey so I was afraid of trying the Prius (maybe next time sans honey), so I got its cheesy cousin. The mix of cheeses and the surprise addition of the onions made the sandwich. Despite its trip in the car that significantly cooled its cheesy core, the sandwich was excellent although for max satisfaction, I think I am going to eat it at the event next time- it's not like it will last long anyway.  <br><br>The next morning, when I drove the car, the savory memory of Drewski's lingered in the car and I started to drool.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",2/14/2012,3,"I tried Drewski's for the second time today with my boyfriend and sister and I can say that the food is pretty solid and consistent.  The line was about 10 people long when I arrived, around 11:30 a.m., but it did move pretty quickly.  They also got the food out pretty quickly as well.  This time around, I tried out:<br><br>-Hemi:  If you get a bite with all of the flavors, it's really tasty.  The problem was that some bites didn't have any macaroni and some bites didn't have onions.  I just wish it were a little bit more evenly distributed.  But still, this sandwich is pretty good.  The pork is not that ""pulled,"" it's more ""chunky.""  But like I said, the flavors work well together and this is probably their best sandwich.  <br><br>-Mustang: The flavor of this sandwich reminded me a lot of Chinese pork jerky.  Actually, the texture did too.  I'm not sure if it's always like how my sandwich was, but the meat was pretty tough to bite through.  Because the meat was so difficult to bite through, some bites were all meat, and some bites were meatless (the meat had already fallen out or been consumed in previous bites).  Ignoring the fact of the tough meat, the sandwich flavor was pretty good.  I enjoyed the kimchi and daikon- I wish there was actually more of this.  <br><br>-Prius: at first, it seems so wrong- apples in a sandwich? and no meat?  But actually, it was quite tasty.  It may have actually been my favorite of the day.  The apples, cheese, honey, and toasted nuts actually work quite well together.  <br><br>The food came out hot and the bread on each of the sandwiches was nicely toasted/grilled.  It was buttery, but not overly buttery and had a nice chewiness to it.  I can see why others like the food a lot, but for some reason, it's just not really for me.  It's pretty tasty and I think it's very solid, but nothing stands out to me.  I'll probably try it out again, but I'm in no rush.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=CNiC7YaqoPwhaLPLaHnUAA

I decided to go for the shorter wait and satisfy my craving for Korean flavor at the same time. <br><br>I have to say, the Mustang was amazing. The beef was perfectly marinated and delicious and the sandwich as a whole was perfect. I got my wife the Tricycle which was a solid no-frills grilled cheese and she loved it.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",3/26/2016,3,"On the day when this mobile chuck wagon was in our area, my boyfriend surprised me by taking me out to dinner after work. I thought we were going to a restaurant of some sort until we arrived at Calvine Rd. near Vintage Park Drive, to find a large crowd of people and cars all trying to make their way onto a vacant lot. This is where in Elk Grove, they were having a food truck gathering. Long lines abounded as we made our way through the masses of hungry people. Besides Drewski's Hot Rod Kitchen, there were 3 other food vehicles present. It was a tough decision, but we chose Drewski's to try first. <br>The menu on display has some interesting selections. I ordered the ""Special"" which was a grilled 9 grain wheat bread sandwich filled with sliced Granny Smith apples, almonds, honey, and brie cheese. My boyfriend ordered the ""Hemi"" which is a grilled pulled pork sandwich on french bread with grilled onions, mac &amp; cheese, and Cheddar cheese. Our sides were sweet potato fries and mac &amp; cheese balls. Plus 2 sweetened ice teas. <br>The down side of coming to this food truck event was, that we had to wait about 20 minutes to pick up our food after already waiting a long time just to place our orders!  And because there was absolutely no place to sit and eat, we had to get it all to go and ended up taking it home. <br>I worried that our sandwiches would get cold and soggy and that the ice in the iced teas would melt from the summer heat. I accurately predicted that this would happen!  As we unwrapped our limp sandwiches to start dining, I noticed that in our haste to get home, Drewski's forgot to include the mac &amp; cheese balls which we had already paid for. <br>And even though this whole food try out was a big disappointment in more ways than one, I still have to give 3 stars to where credit is due, and that is because our food was still very tasty even in it's soggy condition!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=WKXB06num_qLlTbItz9wiA

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",1/27/2016,5,"During the great sandwich famine in the winter of 1732, there was little hope for struggling families across the Hungarian countryside. That was until Drewski's arrived and elevated an entire nation out of hunger and into a national food-coma. <br><br>Okay, perhaps my history is a little off but it's really more of a sandwich parable to teach children the importance of creativity in sandwich making. Clearly, the Drewski family knows this all too well... allow me to demonstrate:<br><br>BREAD                   =======<br>CHEESE                ~~~~~~~<br>MACnCHEESE     ))()((())()((<br>BBQ PORK            //\\\////\////\\\<br>CHEESE                ~~~~~~~<br>BREAD                   =======<br><br>Notice anything strange there? Yea, it's like some kind of narcoleptic chef strolled into the kitchen one afternoon to make a grilled cheese (and passed out). Then woke even hungrier than before and thought ""I'm gonna add some of that BBQ pulled pork to my grilled cheese"" (then passed out again).  Then woke again thinking ""I'M STARVING!!! this bowl of homemade mac n' cheese is going directly IN THE SANDWICH!!!""<br><br>Allright, so there you have it. The Hemi sandwich. I should add that this thing is fat and heavy as hell. I will also echo the previous comments on the deep fried mac n' cheese balls and tater tots. Both are pretty great, but the mac n' cheese balls are uniquely delicious. <br><br>While these guys are clearly awesome, I always like to throw out a few improvement points or wishlist items for consideration. My Drewski's Wishlist includes:<br><br>- Jalapenos or cherry peppers in my mac in cheese (or on the sandwich) Spicy mac n' cheese is just plain awesome. I add Franks red hot or buffalo sauce to any and all mac n' cheese at home.<br><br>- Fatter bread and a little less butter/oil. I would prefer a little more crunch to the bread and maybe texas toast sized slices to hold that mountain of dreamy comfort food. As is stands, the existing bread gets a bit soft/mushy under the weight of these monster sandwiches. <br><br>- Steak or natural cut fries would be rad. Onion rings would be killer. As much as I like tater tots, I almost always prefer good fries.<br><br>- Along with the previous suggestion, how about putting fries and/or onion rings ON a sandwich. I mean really, A Hemi with BBQ sauce and onion rings in there? How about some slaw on there as well. I think I just got fatter writing that sentence.<br><br>===================================<br><br>In closing I have to mention that the staff running the truck are  incredibly friendly. While I agree with the folks who rated 3 or 4, I have to bump up to 5 for service, creativity, and price. Drewski's delivers some really interesting and delicious items at crazy reasonable price, and with fantastic service.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=jrvTYh6NKG-Hd0t-N2Kt8g

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",11/16/2016,4,"First time trying Drewski's. Today's visit from the Drewski team landed them right in the heart of our business parking lot in Arden. They ""drew"" a crowd for sure! Among the many mouth-watering menu items, I opted for the ""Fast Back"" - if you've ever had a Vietnamese bahn mi sandwich - the Fast Back gives you that with an amazing pulled pork twist! I must say the filling was a delight - sweet &amp; smoky pulled pork along side fresh cut jalapeños, cilantro, carrot raddish relish and an amazing aioli! Wish I had a bit more of the aioli - you know you always want more of the good stuff. The bread bun was buttered and toasted and it soaked up the pulled pork au ju - so this sandwich alone had layers of flavor. I also ordered the 'tots - regular - these were really good too! Crunchy and flavorful. I especially am thankful the portions were generous for one serving. (I didn't feel jilted between cost of food and food portion served like some other food trucks do). Thanks for stopping by Drewski's! I enjoyed my food! Definitely come back - I'd like to try the rest of the menu! For 4/5 stars - As much as the bread bun held up to the wetness of the pulled pork - my bread was a bit hard to chew - ended up having to pull off some excess bread to keep the from rubbing the roof of my mouth which was making it a little uncomfortable to eat. Maybe experiment with more breads to find a firm but soft enough combo? I sort of want to blame the cold weather breeze today for possibly causing the turning so if I could do 4.5 stars - that would be my true rating!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=6bAJEHnRRvIJ_a3rtGVj9g

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Rocklin, CA",9/10/2013,5,"Yeah, it's got a Hemi...and I ate it. And I shared some famous tots with my co-worker. Let's just say that my engine revved! The bread...toasted to a buttery perfection...pulled pork perfectly seasoned and not overly sweet and tender...grilled onions actually GRILLED and not just warmed up...cheesy yumminess... and yes, mac &amp; cheese. I read the menu quickly as my tummy was screaming at me to feed it, so I missed the mac &amp; cheese ingredient on the description. The sandwich was great, but the mac &amp; cheese didn't really help it any - probably because it didn't need it. The garlicky tots were a nice compliment and I'm so happy that we split an order of them because there were A LOT of them. Not greasy, either and enough garlic to satisfy but not repel anyone you speak to...maybe except for a vampire.<br><br>I definitely will seek out Drewski's again and wish they'd come to my side of Natomas.

It was wonderful because you don't usually expect much from the food at those types of events. My mom and I split the Hemi and the Prius, my husband got a Hemi and my son got a regular grilled cheese (a Trike?). We all split an order of tots and an order of sweet potato fries. Everyone pretty much loved their food. The Hemi is the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese in it. I wasn't sure how that would taste but it was yummy. The Prius is brie, apples, almonds and honey. I ate my half as a dessert, very good. The tots and fries were both quite good with rosemary and garlic. <br><br>The second time we had Drewski's was at the SactoMoFo Trucktoberfest in West Sacramento. My toddler has been very picky about food lately so I was relieved to see them there because I KNOW he will eat the grilled cheese and tots.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",4/5/2016,5,"Drewski's is one of those experiences that once you try them, you are hooked! Even more evident of that fact is that since they are a food truck and they have wheels and move about, you sometimes feel like a crackhead trying to get your next fix thinking, ""where are they going to be at today?"".  It is almost a game or some strange food paradise scavenger hunt! You never know where they will be and hopefully, you will be lucky enough to be in the area they are that day, dependin on either just good old fashioned luck or by reading their daily posts on Facebook. Okay, enough of that and to the food:<br>The food is amazing! I have only tried two of the grilled sandwiches--the Hemi and the Mustang.  I can't say which one is best--it depends on your mood.  If you like exotic spicy, sweet and salty flavors all together, go for the Mustang.  It is Korea in a sandwich--and Korea is damn good!  The Hemi is a safe bet with it's pulled pork and mac and cheese.  How can it get any better than these two? It can't, damn it--it can't!<br><br>The sides are amazing, too! I highly suggest the rosemary garlic tater tots!! I don't know what they do to them, but they are truly, truly amazing! I think they sprinkle magic dust or something of the like on them.  Be warned, though, since they use fresh garlic (and lots of it), make sure you bring mints or gum afterward! <br><br>The staff are very nice and sometimes the owner, Drewski himself is there.  He is a really cool dude and I always try to let him know how much I appreciate what he does (must be nice to do something you love that makes people smile!).  <br><br>So, treat yourself to Drewski's sometime, you won't regret it and that way I will have a roommate or two at the future new addition of the Betty Ford clinic --- the new Drewski addiction annex!",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=9a1N1NDMNFU83tphZOT73g

It was the perfect combo! I don't even like kimchi but this sammich won me over.<br><br>The Hemi- Mac n Cheese with pulled pork, yummy! I had a bite of it and it was awesome. I want a side of that mac n cheese! <br><br>Tater tots with rosemary and garlic- I thought the rosemary and garlic were going to overpower the lil tots but it sure didn't!

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",5/2/2011,5,"After passively stalking Drewski for a month, I was finally able to catch up with them on 10th and L. Since I'd been meaning to try them out for the past few months, I decided to take advantage of this opportunity and order half the menu.<br><br>I ordered the following:<br><br>   $7.50   Mustang (Korean BBQ and kimchi)<br>   $7.50   Hemi (Pulled pork, caramelized onions, and mac 'n cheese)<br>   $3.00   Fried Mac 'n Cheese Balls<br>   $3.00   Rosemary Garlic Tator Tots<br>+ $1.00   Diet Coke (I've got to watch my figure, y'know)<br>===========<br> $22.00 Total<br><br>Usually, i like to write a rambling review that shares a relevant anecdote or a rant about how food is intertwined with life. I'll do nothing of that sort here. Instead, here's each food item with its taste grade in parenthesis and a few quick notes.<br><br>Mustang (A-): Simply delicious. Although they could improve the sandwich by using bulgogi meat, the addition of authentic Kimchi really helps break up the heavy flavors.  <br><br>Hemi (B): The caramelized onions are a bit too sweet for this heavy sandwich and do not do enough to balance out the flavor. Still, a very tasty sandwich, so YMMV.<br><br>Mac 'n Cheese Balls (A): You almost can't go wrong with this item, though I've seen it happen before. Crispy shell, buttery cheesy goodness on the inside. Only problem here is that you get only 3 balls. <br><br>Tator Tots (A+): My coworkers, who were eager to eat my food, said that these are the best tator tots they've ever had... in Sacramento. The other place was in D.C., so we've definitely got a local winner. A single order of tator tots is pretty generous and the seasoning is perfectly balanced. Once you receive your order, the fragrance of the tator tots will make you down half the order before you can get back to the office.<br><br>Closing Notes:<br>If you're wondering why the grades are high, keep in mind that it's almost impossible not to enjoy food that's been grilled in clarified garlic butter. Of course, you've got to be in the mood for super savory food like this, so if you're hoping for something light and refreshing, go somewhere else. Anyway, the staff were extremely friendly and they seemed to be genuinely interested in my enjoyment of the food. You have to love it when a cook takes pride in his/her dish. <br><br>Seeing as how every coworker that sampled my order subsequently begged me to take them along the next time, I feel very confident in giving Drewski's a 5-star rating.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=YqxigTtFGl51yL_o-KhqEQ

The perfect amount of heat, lots of meat, great bread, good home-made kimchi, and delicious melty cheese all over it. a perfect sandwich, really, and worth every penny of the $7.<br><br>The garlic/rosemary tater tots are some of the best potato-based snack food I have ever or will ever taste.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Orangevale, CA",2/21/2014,2,"Was looking forward to this truck coming through at my work today. But in all honesty, it wasn't that great. I guess I could say I've had better. I try to be really fair &amp; go into new experiences with an open mind. Somehow this just didn't measure up to the reviews I had read previously.<br>I ordered the Drewski Dog($6), the Tricycle($6) &amp; the Sweet Potato Fries($3). <br>    The dog was ok. It had a nice hearty beef taste. The bacon was a little more crisp than I would have like(IE., burned). The bun was broken apart so food fell out the bottom &amp; it was held together by an almost melted piece of cheese. No biggy, I can deal with it. The caramelized onions were barely existent. And the ones there seemed to be more the rind/shell of the onion. You know, that part that is hard &amp; tough to chew. Even caramelized there was no way to eat it. So I picked it off. I didn't get the aioli as I thought it would be too spicy, so I just added a little ketchup &amp; mustard. <br>    The Tricycle was , to me, just a plain old grilled cheese. Nothing to write home about. By the time we got to sitting &amp; eating (5-7 minutes) it was starting to get hard. So it wasn't creamy like I thought it would be. I suspect, if I were to get it again, it should be eaten right away. Also the bread seemed to be very greasy, almost saturated with the clarified butter that it's fried in. Just not my cup of tea.<br>    The Sweet Potato Fries with garlic &amp; rosemary, were almost inedible. They were a few seconds away from being burnt. Not sure if they use olive oil or not but the rosemary &amp; garlic basically settled at the bottom of the container. There was absolutely none coating the fries. Wasn't too happy either that they were plated with the dog. The fries were actually for the Tricycle so I had to gingerly remove the dog from the fries as it was sitting directly on top! <br><br>It could just have been a bad day for these folks.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Los Angeles, CA",,3,I have really mixed feelings about Drewski's!!! <br><br>It's obviously really good but really rich!!!! I get the Mustang (Korean inspired sando with kimchi and cheese). It's usually sooooooo good but last time it was just literally OVERFLOWING with meat it was kinda a turn off. I had to pick most of the meat out to make a regular sized sandwich. On a good day tho it's amazing. I would suggest sharing sandwiches because they are super filling.<br><br>The mac and cheese balls I think are completely overrated. I got them once and I didn't think they were anything special. I agree with everyone who says they need to be more cheesy... they're missing something!!!<br><br>I'm interested in trying the new nutella one. Sounds delish! Friends  have had the apple and walnut sando and said it was really good but more like a dessert. <br><br>Drewski himself annoys the eff out of me. He's just too intense like jumping around and what not. It makes me nervous lol. Now they have some cute stoner looking boy working the window which is fine but he seemed a little unorganized when it came to taking orders.,https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=oBJOvknegipEL_2VUNGcBg
Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",9/6/2011,5,"Yes, most of my reviews tend to be more praise and I know that may be off putting to some but my philosopy is to promote the businesses that provide me a great experience and the ones that just do ok or not good at all, I let it be dust in the wind. I given another chance later so I hold back my opinions.<br><br>Now with that caveat out of the way lets talk about Drewski's Hot Rod Kitchen. They were parked over in front of the Monte Carlo so I raced from my office and partook of a HEMI sandwich, deep fried mac n' cheese and some sweet potato fries. The HEMI is something you have to try to believe. Its delicious, the fries are the best I have ever had and the mac n' cheese balls were amazing. I only ate one and gave the other 2 to coworkers to try.<br><br>Later that night, like an hour and a half later I had their food again. This time it was the Mustang which for me is difficult to describe as anything but unique and delicious. I paired that with their tots this time and they are they are supreme and washed it down with their sweet mint tea. I enjoyed the tea, it paired with my cigar nicely though the girlfriend did not like it.<br><br>The biggest up-sell of Drewski's is the speed at which you get your food. Amazingly fast compared to the competition and the quality is above par. Will I eat there again, yes. I would recommend them to anyone and I would like to see them at more events around the city and the draconian laws against food trucks abolished. Competition is good.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=thiVlK_6v26zCpXfo55ewg

The Mustang had marinated pulled pork, homemade kimchi, and a mayo'y' sauce. I thought it was just 'ok'. If it wasn't for the hype, I'm not sure I would have tried it. <br><br>Don't get me wrong, it's not terrible food but just be warned that you get a fair amount of grease in your mouth at every bite. It's def a hardy meal and certainly not for the faint-hearted.

I walked up, did not even look at the menu, handed the order taker some money and asked for ""what ever's good"" (which by the way is probably the best way to order from a new place). WOW I was blown away. A few mins later I was hand delivered, to the nearby park bench, an amazing pulled pork and mac &amp; cheese grilled cheese sandwich, sweet potato fries and a fresh sweet tea. <br><br>One bite in and I was sold. I whipped out my phone, and shot right to Twitter, I had to follow this truck! Since then I have been back a few times. <br>Every time I go, I am greeted with a warm welcome, and a handshake from the owner. Andrew is very passionate about his business, his truck, and most importantly his food. <br><br>I cannot speak for all the menu items, as I have not yet gotten over the amazingness of the Hemi, but on paper (or marker-board rather) they all look amazing.

Turns out this guy is Owner-Chef Andrew. I told him my dilemma, and asked if he could prepare something a little lighter for me.

The salty short ribs with the spicy Kimchi were a good combo. However, I couldn't really taste any of the other condiments on the sandwich. The same goes for the other two sandwiches. Maybe the flavors just blended together or maybe I was just way too hungry at that point to care, but the flavors didn't pop out as ""gourmet"" to me.<br><br>Nevertheless, my favorite sides were the fried mac and cheese and creme brulee.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Carmichael, CA",5/3/2015,1,"Unfortunately this was not as good as I expected, mostly because it was a pain in the butt to find the drewski truck.  The food is decent but definitely NOT worth chasing the  truck around. <br>On 2 separate occasions we drove out to places the truck was supposed to be, according to their facebook posts, and both times the truck was no longer there. On both occasions, the posts were less than 3 hrs old. On one of these instances, I tried to contact drewskis via facebook to see if they has just moved because their truck was no longer where they said it was. I got no response. I feel it is poor customer service when you do not update your current location (I.e post when you leave please so hungry customers do not spend time driving around looking for you). <br>Third time is the charm because we finally found the truck downtown. Boyfriend and I split the hemi, mustang, and an order of rosemary-garlic tots. They were all decent BUT nothing special.  I didn't feel it was worth all that driving around and hunting the truck down.

I have to say it was an unusual sandwich but the combination of ingredients was quite tasty. I got it with the tater tots but I found the tots to be a disappointment.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",10/7/2012,4,"I've eaten at this truck a few times, a couple times at a truck gathering in Citrus Heights, and then at the Aftershock concert. I've had the Mac &amp; Cheese balls a couple of times, &amp; I've had the Hemi. The Hemi could have been better. It was at Aftershock &amp; the pulled pork was a little dry but it was still pretty delicious &amp; I would order it again. The Mac &amp; Cheese balls are pretty amazing, they are a little bit gourmet &amp; I love the bacon in them! I took my mom to a truck gathering last week &amp; the only vegetarian entree option available for her from any truck was the Prius sandwich so she ordered that. It sounds a little odd, but she let me try it &amp; it was a delicious melding of flavors. The Prius has luscious melted brie &amp; anything with brie is good! But seriously, the apples, smoked almonds, &amp; honey all worked really nicely together &amp; it's a great sandwich with sophisticated flavors. She said it was pretty filling also. Surprisingly enough, I think the Prius is the best thing I've tried from Drewski's!

I was so torn between The Special (shout out to Jessica T)and The Hemi, but I ended up going with The Hemi. And boy was it yummy! The sauce the pulled pork was in wasn't too sweet or tangy, but just right. And it didn't make my bread soggy with sauce. There was a decent amount of meat on the sandwich. The balance of pork, mac n cheese, and onions was perfect. The clarified garlic butter was great on the bread; not too garlicky or overwhelming. It was great meeting Mr. Drewski himself, too; as well as, momma Drewski and big sis Drewski. He's really personable (and easy on the eyes!). It was nice to see the man behind the truck taking a brief hiatus to mingle with us regular folk. I'm glad I got a Sweet Mint Tea to accompany my sandwich; it was extremely refreshing.  I definitely see The Special and creme brulee in my future, so I'll surely be twitter/FB stalking them until I can get my hands on another tasty creation.",https://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TwwpL5rUI2wtjmFJVh9QGg

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",4/16/2012,5,"I have dreams about the mustang sandwich.  My mouth will water spontaneously for it.  My husband brought home Drewskis late one night the sandwich and tots were cold but he insisted I try it. I took a bite of the stang and was totally confused it was sweet yet spicy and not like anything I would have ever eaten (I'm not a pulled saucy pork girl nor did I think kimchi could be so bad ass and yes I do know what kimchi consists of) suffice to say I'm hooked!  I always eat half of this sandwich hot and the other half when its refrig cold.  Paradise in a sammich? Yes I can't even....its amazeballs (which is what they should name the mac n cheese balls).  So far the stang and tots, sweet tater fries, mac n cheese ballz, smoreski are all I have tried, I go to try another sandwich but I get suckered into the mustang every freakin time!

I can't recall the name but I tasted it and it was good. My only complaint is the fries weren't cooked enough. I'll be back and try them again. Hopefully it was a fluke and they'll be crispy and not super limp next time. Food came out fast and the staff was friendly.

Drewski’s Hot Rod Kitchen,"Sacramento, CA",3/3/2012,1,"A lot of hype. First time here &amp; it took about 20 minutes to get my food. Time was around 2:30pm so the truck wasn't swamped with people. Mustang was on sliced sourdough bread- menu said a french roll &amp; no one said they were out. Would have been nice to know. The beef in the mustang was either over cooked or old. Kim chee was too young so it tasted weird. The sweet potato fries were burned. My girlfriend got the tricycle and I can't believe they charge $5 for two pieces of grilled bread with hardly any cheese in the middle. Felt like I wasted my time and money. I really hope I caught this truck on an off day. I don't understand how people rave on this food. I'm not going to give the truck a second look when I see them out and about and wouldn't recommend them to friends. Oh and I hope for the future, they will at least park near or have their own trash can around so others won't have to hunt for one.
